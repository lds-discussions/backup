        <h1>FAIR Mormon's New Video War on the CES Letter: LOL Seer Stones Are Awesome</h1>

        <p>
            This past Thanksgiving, the FAIR Mormon YouTube channel launched a series of videos that 'declared war on
            the CES Letter.' The video series features Kwaku, who is a young church apologist from other video series
            such as Saints Unscripted, and has recently been in the news for holding underground dance parties in Provo,
            UT during the global pandemic under the name 'Young and Dumb.'
        </p>

        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="images/seerstone-fair-1.webp" alt="young dumb" class="image-style-fixed">
            <img src="images/seerstone-fair-2.webp" alt="young dumb" class="image-style-fixed">
        </div>

        <p>
            They named the series This Is The Show, which has the acronym TITS. If you don't think that's intentional,
            just reread the above paragraph and take a look at the coverage from the 'Young and Dumb' parties. Kwaku has
            always been someone focused on entertainment, self-promotion, and brand building, and this is certainly one
            way to achieve that.
            <br><br>
            The videos come across as aggressive and condescending towards those who have doubts, which seems to
            undermine the very purpose of the channel: helping people with doubts disbelieve the information in the CES
            Letter. The tone in many of these videos is one of outright mockery towards those who leave the church, and
            the content is heavily loaded with attacks on both Jeremy Runnells and the CES Letter itself. In one video,
            they call the CES Letter 'trash,' and throughout the series, they suggest that any ideas coming from the
            ex-Mormon community are somehow untrustworthy. This, despite the fact that many apologists have joined that
            community after realizing the evidence clearly shows that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is
            not true.
            <br><br>
            A few people asked if I would do a write-up on these videos. Initially, I wasn’t planning to, but after
            listening to four or five of them, I felt it would be useful to illustrate how dishonest they are in their
            attempts to discredit the CES Letter.
            <br><br>
            One quick note: the CES Letter is far from perfect. It includes some weak arguments and specific criticisms
            that, for the sake of accuracy, should be removed. However, the power of the CES Letter lies not in Jeremy
            Runnells as an individual, but in its ability to clearly outline major problems with the church’s
            history—problems that most members were completely unaware of.
            <br><br>
            As a member of record, I converted to the church in the 1990s. I can say with absolute certainty that the
            issues presented in the CES Letter were never mentioned to me as an investigator, nor during my years in the
            church. No amount of mockery from apologists can change the shock I felt upon learning about some of the
            more significant issues with church history, which I uncovered when I finally decided to explore the CES
            Letter in order to determine whether my doubts about the church were justified.
            <br><br>
            One of the biggest shocks was discovering that Joseph Smith used the same stone he claimed to see buried
            treasure with—but never found—to translate the Book of Mormon. This was vastly different from the story I
            had been taught as an investigator, where Joseph Smith was depicted as studiously translating gold plates on
            a table. To say this revelation was a departure from the church's narrative is an understatement. For that
            reason, I wanted to start with their video titled 'The CES Letter LOLOLOL, Seer Stones Are Awesome.' (wich
            is now private)
        </p>

        <p>
            For the video I am going to refer to the hosts as TITS, because that's what they named their series, that's
            what FAIR Mormon has decided is OK to own the anti-Mormons, and because my Amazon transcription didn't tell
            me which of the two hosts made each comment. If that bothers you, then your problem is with FAIR Mormon for
            endorsing and including this video series under their umbrella.
            <br><br>
            With that introduction out of the way, on to the video:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            You know what? I don't get how people act like the seer stone part of the translation process is like the
            deal breaker. You know what I mean? It starts off with Moroni, an ancient Native American who dies and goes
            to heaven and comes back as a glowing angel. That's fine, right? Literally an Indian flying through time and
            space to get to Palmyra in New York is okay, but once you put a rock in a hat, that's where it gets crazy.
            Let's talk about rocks.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This is the intro to the video, and it really hits the tone of how TITS is going to frame the issue of
            Joseph Smith translating the Book of Mormon with a peep/seer stone in a hat. But the reason that it "gets
            crazy" when we dig into the history of the translation isn't just because it was a rock, but because of
            where the rock came from and how it was used before the Book of Mormon was composed.
            <br><br>
            This video never mentions that Joseph Smith used the same stone to look for buried treasure that he used to
            translate the Book of Mormon. For a video series that is claiming the CES is dishonest, deceptive, and
            "trash," it is noteworthy that they immediately frame the problem with the "rocks" in a strawman argument,
            leaving out key reasons that so many members find this to be a real testimony breaker.
            <br><br>
            While God did use ordinary people for extraordinary things in the stories of the Bible, Joseph Smith took
            people's money to locate hidden treasure/objects and failed at every instance to find anything. That can not
            be overstated as he used the very same stone to defraud people out of their money as he did to translate the
            Book of Mormon. Put another way, if God was preparing Joseph by giving him a seer stone with magical powers
            to find buried treasure, then why did Joseph Smith never find anything? They know about these problems, but
            chose to leave them out. I'll let you wonder why that is.
            <br><br>
            Back to the video:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            The CES letter quotes respected, active latter day Saint scholar Richard Bushman who said, "What in the
            world or the plates for? Why do we need them on the table if they're just wrapped up into a cloth when he
            looks into a seer stone?" As many know, Joseph Smith used the Urim and Thummim to translate the Book of
            Mormon. Since Joseph was the prophet of the restoration, he would be spiritually numbered among ancient
            people, like the priest of the Old Testament, who used the Urim and Thummim, aka magic rocks, to perform the
            will of God, or even Aaron, who used a magic stick. Joseph used seer stones that would tell him what was
            written on the golden plates. And this is how the Book of Mormon was translated.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            First, we need to address the term Urim and Thummim, because Joseph Smith's seer/peep stone is nothing like
            the biblical Urim and Thummim. We cover all of this a lot more in-depth in the annotated LDS essay on the
            Book of Mormon translation, but the Urim and Thummim did not translate anything - they were not "seer
            stones" in the way Joseph Smith claimed to use them and the church now admits today. They worked more like a
            magic 8-ball, only giving you answers of yes or no. The black stone translates to 'Yes' and the white stone
            translates to 'No' for questions the high priests would ask. They did not have the ability to find hidden
            objects or to project translated words from golden plates that were not even in the room with Joseph at the
            time he was using the stone in a hat.
            <br><br>
            Furthermore, the term 'Urim and Thummim' was not even used to describe the "seer stone" or any translation
            process of the Book of Mormon until WW Phelps used it in 1832 in reference to the Nephite interpreters and
            not Joseph's seer/peep stone.. Originally Joseph spoke of having Nephite Interpreters, but those were taken
            when Joseph Smith lost the initial 116 pages. Upon resuming translation, Joseph switched to the stone in a
            hat for the Book of Mormon as we have it today according to both Emma Smith and David Whitmer. This becomes
            even more clear when we get to D&C 17, which TITS brings up a bit later.
            <br><br>
            This is important because TITS wants to equate Joseph Smith's peep/seer stone with the biblical Urim and
            Thummim, but that term only arose years after the Book of Mormon was written as they looked for biblical
            parallels to the process. You have to remember that Joseph Smith and the witnesses all came from a very
            magical worldview where they believed in buried treasure, seer stones, and visions, but a lot of new members
            knew better and the church began trying to re-frame the magic into biblical terminology, and the conflation
            of objects was born.
            <br><br>
            Back to the video:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            So why did Richard Bushman act as if there was no need for the plates? Well, he didn't. Jeremy Reynolds and
            his subreddit herd of flying monkeys are specifically not including a part of the interview where he talks
            about why the golden plates were necessary. They deliberately left this out to manipulate you. Oh, you don't
            say. I do say. Here's the quote. "People say that the Book of Mormon certainly isn't inspired and inspiring
            book. But the back story of the plates in the translation is irrelevant to it. What would we gain and lose
            [if we abandon the plates]? What we would lose would be a powerful form of the evidence that the Lord gave
            to Joseph Smith and tow us of the actuality of these experiences and therefore the actuality of the
            transcendent sphere... that would be gutting some of the most gritty and appealing parts of the Mormon
            story."
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            In this case, TITS is either being intentionally dishonest or lazy in their research. The quote from the CES
            Letter is the full answer to a question - TITS just does not inform the reader of the full, long quote used.
            I'll do that for them here, because that's what we're supposed to do to be honest, right? Here's the CES
            Letter's quote from church historian Richard Bushman:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            "I will begin by saying that we still have pictures on our Ward bulletin boards of Joseph Smith with the
            Gold Plates in front of him. That has become an irksome point and I think it is something the church should
            pay attention to. Because anyone who studies the history knows that is not what happened. There is no church
            historian who says that is what happened and yet it is being propagated by the church and it feeds into the
            notion that the church is trying to cover up embarrassing episodes and is sort of prettifying its own
            history.

            So, I think we ought to just stop that immediately. I am not sure we need a lot of pictures in our chapels
            of Joseph looking into his hat, but we certainly should tell our children that is how it worked... It’s
            weird. It’s a weird picture. It implies it’s like darkening a room when we show slides. It implies that
            there is an image appearing in that stone and the light would make it more difficult to see that image. So,
            that implies a translation that’s a reading and so gives us a little clue about the whole translation
            process. It also raises the strange question, ‘What in the world are the plates for? Why do we need them on
            the table if they are just wrapped up into a cloth while he looks into a seer stone?’" <a

        </blockquote>

            Now you can see why TITS did not want to mention the rest of the quote, because it highlights the problem
            that they are saying doesn't exist: That the church taught a narrative of the translation that is
            historically not true.
            <br><br>
            This interview is a FAIR Mormon podcast from October 2010 - you can listen to it <a
                href="https://www.fairlatterdaysaints.org/blog/2010/10/12/fair-podcast-episode-3-richard-l-bushman-p-1">here</a>
            at the 47:25 mark.
            <br><br>
            The quote that TITS uses to imply that the CES Letter was somehow being dishonest with the quote in the CES
            Letter is from a completely separate presentation given a few weeks later where Bushman was responding to a
            question about taking the Book of Mormon as an inspired text rather than a literal one from gold plates. You
            can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=2482&v=_JszPhRekPk&feature=youtu.be">view that presentation
                here</a> and I've even linked it to the exact moment of this quote.
            <br><br>
            Put another way, the quote from the CES Letter is 100% legitimate even if Richard Bushman gave a different
            opinion in the later presentation. The only people cutting off the quote here is TITS, which is because they
            don't want to admit that the church did teach an incorrect narrative. Bushman in the FAIR Mormon interview
            is talking about the questions that arise for many when they discover the true method of the Book of Mormon
            translation, which is absolutely fair game to post because it highlights that the church has hidden this
            history from its members, which Bushman outlines in the part of the quote that TITS conveniently left off.
            <br><br>
            I'm not sure what more to say here. It's dishonest to say that Runnells "deliberately left this out to
            manipulate you" when the quote TITS is using here is from a completely separate presentation in response to
            a different question. Either TITS knows this and just doesn't care, or they were lazy with their research
            and just looked up the response from other CES rebuttals and just didn't bother to actually look at the
            source of the two quotes.
            <br><br>
            Back to the video:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            In the CES Letter, Runnells criticizes Joseph Smith for using a Ouija board to translate the Book of Mormon.
            The only problem is that the Ouija board wasn't created until 1894 and Joseph Smith translated the Book of
            Mormon in 1829. Also know Joseph didn't use a Ouija board to translate the Book of Mormon. If you believe a
            bogus lie like that, you probably believe Jesse Smollett or that you're gonna win a cruise on an Instagram
            giveaway. You're not.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This is intentionally dishonest, and it's ironic that it comes in the very next section after TITS accused
            Runnells of lying about a quote from Bushman (even though they were wrong there as well). This is what the
            CES Letter says about Ouija boards:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            "In other words, Joseph used the same magic device or “Ouija Board” that he used during his treasure hunting
            days. He put a rock – called a “peep stone” – in his hat and put his face in the hat to tell his customers
            the location of buried treasure on their property. He also used this same method for translating the Book of
            Mormon, while the gold plates were covered, placed in another room, or even buried in the woods. The gold
            plates were not used for the Book of Mormon we have today."
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Now you can understand why TITS left out the context - they don't want members to understand that Joseph
            Smith used the same rock to translate the Book of Mormon that he claimed to see bury treasure with, but in
            no way is Jeremy Runnells saying that Joseph Smith used a Ouija Bord. He is saying that Joseph Smith is
            using the same device that he claimed to find buried treasure with (although he never actually found any)
            that is similar to the power of a Ouija board to translate the Book of Mormon.
            <br>
            Again, that is beyond obvious by a simply reading of this paragraph, which TITS is hoping that members won't
            actually do because it's more helpful to their cause to take shots at the CES Letter rather than actually
            attempting to give an honest rebuttal.
            <br>
            Back to the video:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            He did use seer stones to translate by the process of logic. It's bizarre that someone would use this as a
            weapon against the church. Joseph Smith's first divine claim was that God and Jesus appeared to him. If you
            don't believe in God or Jesus, then you don't believe Joseph's claim.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            It's not "bizarre" that most people find it odd and problematic that the same stone that Joseph Smith used
            to make money as a treasure digger was used to translate the Book of Mormon when we were taught that God
            preserved ancient interpreters for the very purpose of translating the gold plates. To put simply, if Joseph
            Smith could never actually find lost treasure with this stone as he claimed he could see, then why in the
            world should anyone think it would later get divine/supernatural powers later to read text off gold plates
            that were never actually used? There's nothing logical about this beyond it pointing to the pattern of a
            fraud, which is why the church continued to teach a false history to converts such as myself.
            <br><br>
            Also, TITS here claims that Joseph Smith's first divine claim was that God and Jesus appeared to him, but
            what they don't note is that Joseph Smith's first divine claim was just one being appearing to him in his
            1832 First Vision. That story would later to change to both God and Jesus as his theology changed, which we
            cover in the First Vision Overview page. If they want to claim the CES Letter is playing fast and loose with
            the facts, then they really need to get these basic facts correct themselves.
            <br><br>
            Back to the video:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            The seer stone divinity is operating under the umbrella of God existing. The CES Letter is atheistic, and
            examining the seer stone under an umbrella in which there isn't a God is meaningless. If you do believe in
            God and Jesus that you've opened the door for angels, spirits and all sorts of supernatural things. It's not
            as if this is technically weirder than those things. If you don't believe in anything supernatural or
            divine, then obviously you wouldn't believe that God could use objects for divine purposes. So essentially,
            we're saying who cares?
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This is an area that TITS likes to really knock the CES Letter with. It doesn't matter if someone is
            "atheistic" or from another religion when it comes to Mormon history. This is simply a way to distract from
            the problems that are outlined not just by the CES Letter, but this site and others as well - and we all
            come from different beliefs and backgrounds.
            <br><br>
            And, yes, this absolutely is "weirder" than other things in the Bible. Did anyone ever see Moses using his
            staff to con people out of their money looking for buried treasure before using it in the Bible to part the
            Red Sea? The use of Joseph Smith's stone in treasure digging is incredibly important to the Book of Mormon
            translation, which is why TITS left it completely out of the video.
            <br><br>
            Back to the video:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            The CES Letter is making a claim that nobody knew about seer stones until recently and that the church
            didn't talk about it. For one, that's nonsense. Because whenever we teach about Joseph Smith, we discussed
            the Urim and Thummim. In fact, if you Google the words, the first thing you see are magic Jewish rocks from
            the Old Testament. It's also plainly spoken about in doctrine and covenants Section 17 and 10. It's been
            referenced throughout church history numerous times now.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Calling something "nonsense" doesn't make it so, and TITS is using a distraction here to make their claim.
            As we've already discussed above, the Urim and Thummim was always conflated by the church with the
            "spectacles" or "Nephite interpreters" along with Joseph sitting at the table with the gold plates.
            <br><br>
            If you "Google the words" what you will find out is that the Urim and Thummim in the Bible is nothing like
            what Joseph Smith claimed it was. It was effectively a biblical Magic 8 Ball, giving a yes or no answer to
            questions. The image above literally tells us that - this is not an issue where there is disagreement. In no
            way did the biblical Urim and Thummim have the ability to find buried treasure, see the gold plates sitting
            in a log, or translate ancient records, which is why this comparison is disingenuous at best.
            <br><br>
            Again, the church (and those who are putting this information together here) is well aware of all of these
            details, but they continue to muddy the water by using the term Urim and Thummim interchangeably, even
            though the original Urim and Thummim in the Bible has nothing to do with translating ancient text or
            receiving revelations - it was merely a way to determine a yes or no answer to a question.
            <br><br>
            As for it being "plainly spoken about in doctrine and covenants Section 17 and 10," I want to point out the
            following:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            <a href="https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/revelation-spring-1829-dc-10/1">D&C 10
                <strong>Original
                    Manuscript</strong></a>: "Now, behold, I say unto you, that because you delivered up so many
            writings, which you
            had power to translate, into the hands of a wicked man, you have lost them."
            <br><br>
            D&C 10 <strong>with 1835 changes</strong>: "Now, behold, I say unto you, that because you delivered up those
            writings which
            you had power given unto you to translate by the means of the Urim and Thummim, into the hands of a wicked
            man, you have lost them."
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Notice that the phrase "Urim and Thummim" was retroactively added to the revelation by Joseph Smith when he
            made many crucial changes to revelations directly from God. Again, that might seem like it is "plainly
            spoken about" when we look at it today, when you dig into the history the picture looks a lot different.
            <br><br>
            Now let's look at D&C 17:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            D&C 17 <strong>with 1835 changes</strong>: "Behold, I say unto you, that you must rely upon my word, which
            if you do with full purpose of heart, you shall have a view of the plates, and also of the breastplate, the
            sword of Laban, the Urim and Thummim, which were given to the brother of Jared upon the mount, when he
            talked with the Lord face to face, and the miraculous directors which were given to Lehi while in the
            wilderness, on the borders of the Red Sea."
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This actually proves my point which is that the Urim and Thummim was never taught as Joseph Smith's stone
            that he used for treasure digging. To be clear, this revelation by Joseph Smith is explicit that the Urim
            and Thummim was given to the brother of Jared in the Book of Mormon which means that it is not the stone
            Joseph Smith used for either treasure digging or dictating the Book of Mormon.
            <br><br>
            Again, a simple reading of this revelation would show that, which makes me wonder why TITS decided to use
            D&C 17 as proof that the church has always taught that Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon with a
            rock in a hat. Again, if the Urim and Thummim was Joseph's stone, then why did the witnesses need to have a
            full purpose of heart to see it? We can all see it today in photos on the church website - this is not an
            item that can only be seen in a visionary state like the sword of Laban, Nephite interpreters, and gold
            plates.
            <br><br>
            Not only did the church not "plainly" speak of the Urim and Thummim, they actively taught an incorrect
            history. In the image below, we put the South Park depiction of the translation from 2003 against the
            official church depiction of the translation in the Joseph Smith movie shown at visitors centers released in
            2005.

        </figcaption>

        <p>
            When South Park is telling a more honest history of the translation than the church, you cannot claim the
            church was being upfront about their history. In 2005, two years after South Park made an episode about how
            the Book of Mormon was translated, the church filmed a new movie that continued the dishonest translation
            narrative for visitors who might be interested in the church to see. That was an intentionally dishonest
            decision to teach visitors an incorrect history, and there is no way to rationalize it any other way.
            <br><br>
            More to the point, here is what Prophet Joseph F. Smith had to say about the use of a peep/seer stone to
            translate the Book of Mormon:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            "While the statement has been made by some writers that the Prophet Joseph Smith used a seer stone part of
            the time in his translating of the record, and information points to the fact that he did have in his
            possession such a stone, yet there is no authentic statement in the history of the Church which states that
            the use of such a stone was made in that translation. The information is all hearsay, and personally, I do
            not believe that this stone was used for this purpose. The reason I give for this conclusion is found in the
            statement of the Lord to the Brother of Jared as recorded in Ether 3:22-24
            <br><br>
            These stones, the Urim and Thummim which were given to the Brother of Jared, were preserved for this very
            purpose of translating the record, both of the Jaredites and the Nephites. Then again the Prophet was
            impressed by Moroni with the fact that these stones were given for that very purpose. It hardly seems
            reasonable to suppose that the Prophet would substitute something evidently inferior under these
            circumstances. It may have been so, but it is so easy for a story of this kind to be circulated due to the
            fact that the Prophet did possess a seer stone, which he may have used for some other purposes." (Joseph
            Fielding Smith, Doctrines of Salvation, 3:225)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Joseph F. Smith is making a point we made earlier about the reference to D&C 17, which is that we are to
            believe that God prepared these stones for the brother of Jared and preserved them for thousands of years so
            that Joseph could translate the gold plates by using the Nephite interpreters, only to then allow Joseph to
            use a treasure seeking rock instead for convenience. In that regard, Joseph F. Smith is correct - it "hardly
            seems reasonable" to believe that is possible, which is why the church lied to members about their history
            until the Internet made it impossible to continue.
            <br><br>
            Back to the video:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            "Obviously, we don't spend Sunday school talking about the rocks of Joseph or the staff of Moses or the Rod
            of Aaron. Jesus is more important. However, this lack of attention doesn't mean the church was maliciously
            withholding anything.
            <br><br>
            Now the CES Letter goes on for a long time about how Joseph Smith put the rock and a hat that was to block
            out light. So essentially, God was using the stones as a device to show letters, words, and/or images sort
            of like an iPhone or a Samsung if you don't want her to text you back."
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Yes, the church doesn't spend Sunday school talking about Joseph Smith's rocks, which is because it's
            embarrassing. They talk about the translation and Joseph Smith's history, but they tend to leave out the
            problems such as treasure digging, polygamy, polyandry, and Joseph's failed revelations.
            <br><br>
            But when I was a convert to the church, they absolutely talked about the translation by showing me images of
            Joseph Smith sitting at a table translating the Book of Mormon with the "Nephite interpreters" that were
            originally spoken of both in D&C 17 and supposedly buried with the plates.
            <br><br>
            Apologists love to use a phone analogy here, but the reality again is that the biblical Urim and Thummim was
            a yes or no device that would have no need to have light hidden. If they want to keep making this assertion,
            then saying that Joseph Smith's peep/seer stone functioned like an iPhone is like saying that you found a
            Magic 8 Ball that can project words and images.
            <br><br>
            There's a reason the church taught an incorrect story until the 'Google era' allowed members to find this
            information so easily, and it's because the idea of a rock in a hat with words appearing on it is weird, and
            it also opens up a whole slew of problems for the Book of Mormon's translation as well.
            <br><br>
            Back to the video:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            "This begs the question. Why did Joseph need the golden plates? If the translation process was largely
            without plates at all, I think it's because the plates are a literal testimony of God. They contained the
            written testimonies of ancient prophets, and they themselves are a divine physical miracle. Joseph had to
            guard them from robbers. Sometimes he even had to fight people. He had to keep the plates, a literal
            testimony, safe. I believe this is the Lord's way of training Joseph for what was to come. It was a physical
            representation of Joseph's dedication to God of his willingness to fight for the testimony of the gospel, to
            fight for the church and to defend even until the end."
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            I really don't have much to add here. There's no evidence the gold plates existed beyond the witness
            statements, which are contradictory. It's also pretty difficult to believe Joseph Smith was running with
            heavy metal plates while also being able to fight people off, but that's a story that built up the legend of
            Joseph Smith much like the Transfiguration of Brigham Young was used to give Brigham more credibility as the
            next prophet of God, even though we know it never happened.
            <br><br>
            I'm also not sure what having gold plates that were never actually used accomplishes as a "way of training
            Joseph for what was to come," but that's the same problem I have with the idea that Joseph Smith using the
            stone to take money to look for treasure he never located with God preparing him for what was to come as
            Richard Bushman suggested.
            <br><br>
            On to the final part of the video:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            "That's funny. People who are like 'Oh, use seer stone to translate.' Half the country believes that Jesus
            walked on water and that a virgin gave birth. That a virgin gave birth. You believe that you do the Joseph
            can't you seer stones? Alright, my gosh. You guys watch WWE and you believed it. Oh, yeah, but seer stones,
            that's where you draw the line."
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Again TITS is attempting to belittle legitimate concerns about Joseph Smith using a stone in a hat to
            translate the Book of Mormon by trying to equate it with biblical stories and the WWE. While that might
            sound comforting to those who want a reason to brush this issue aside, it's just a bad comparison when you
            understand the history of the stone Joseph Smith used to translate the Book of Mormon.
            <br><br>
            This was one of their shorter videos, but I thought it would be good to outline how they are doing all of
            the things they attack the CES Letter for. The bottom line is that attacking members who have problems with
            church history might feel good to those who are 'all in' with the church, but it will absolutely turn off
            those who are struggling as they learn about church history.
            <br><br>
            And FAIR Mormon allowing a series with the acronym TITS to 'declare war' on the CES Letter shows that they
            have no ability to win back the youth who have more access to this information than any generation before
            them, and they are throwing the kitchen sink at the problems that this information is creating for the
            church.
            <br><br>
            I also realize that by writing about this video, it is giving TITS the attention they wanted, but I also
            believe that outlining just how dishonest they can be in a 5 minute video is important to those who might be
            watching the videos and feeling like they were lied to from both the CES Letter and websites like ours.

            The problem for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints isn't that you can't prove that the church
            is true, but that you can prove it is false. If the church was true, as the leaders and apologists claim,
            they would be asking every member to research their claims for themselves and take the church for a test
            drive. Instead, we have a constant stream of talks and videos from both leaders and apologists mocking those
            with doubts, demonizing those who leave, or telling members not to research beyond correlated, church
            approved sources.
            <br><br>
            Not only has this new TITS series deleted comments where viewers corrected their misinformation, they have
            disabled comments completely at times since they were released. This series by FAIR Mormon is not about
            having an honest dialogue about what is true in the church - this series is about shouting down the CES
            Letter and anyone who reads it so that they can present their view and only their view. While that might
            work for those who feel a need to believe, it will ultimately cause many shelves to come crashing down once
            they are open to digging into these sources just a little bit more.
            <br><br>
            And that tells you everything you need to know, and no amount of misleading TITS videos will change that.
            (Again, if you found my use of TITS to be vulger or beneath me, just ask yourself why FAIR Mormon decided to
            endorse and highlight them within their YouTube channel.)
