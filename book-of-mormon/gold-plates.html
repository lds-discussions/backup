        <p>
            In our last section, we looked at Joseph Smith’s involvement in treasure digging because as we get into the
            Book of Mormon itself, we can see how treasure digging directly influenced the Book of Mormon from the
            account of the gold plates through the text itself.
        </p>

        <h3>Treasure Digging and the Gold Plates – A Timeline</h3>
        <p>
            Before we get to the translation of the Book of Mormon, it’s important to look at how the gold plates were
            claimed to be received by Joseph Smith. This is important because as we covered in our last section on
            treasure digging, the history is much different than the narrative we are taught as members.
        </p>

        <p>
            According to the church, Joseph Smith’s First Vision happens in 1820 which is followed by the visit from the
            Angel Moroni in 1823. From there we are told that Joseph Smith makes a yearly visit to the Hill Cumorah to
            get the gold plates, finally receiving them in 1827. According to Joseph Smith’s 1838 history:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “Accordingly, as I had been commanded, I went at the end of each year, and at each time I found the same
            messenger there, and received instruction and intelligence from him at each of our interviews, respecting
            what the Lord was going to do, and how and in what manner his kingdom was to be conducted in the last days.”
            (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1?lang=eng">Joseph Smith
                History</a>)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            he timeline of the church’s narrative has some problems, and I want to briefly cover them here. First, there
            is no contemporary account of the First Vision being told by Joseph Smith before 1832. We cover this in our
            First Vision Overview, which is important because the church needs the First Vision to occur before 1823 to
            fit with Joseph Smith’s account of Moroni’s visit, but the historical record tells us if it happened in any
            manner, it couldn’t have been before 1824.
        </p>

        <p>
            Second, Joseph Smith’s visits to retrieve the plates were always on the autumnal equinox, which is a very
            important day in magical practices such as treasure digging. This is incredibly important because in magic
            and occult practices, this is the time of the year when the ‘veil is lifted:’
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “Mabon [Autumnal Equinox] is a useful time for practicing protection magic as well as prosperity magic.
            (According to pagan beliefs, the veil between the spiritual and mortal worlds is particularly thin around
            the autumnal equinox.) Any form of divination you partake in will be particularly revealing now, and
            meditating on the balance between light and dark and this space of equilibrium is also customary.” (<a
                href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/a-modern-witchs-guide-to-celebrating-the-fall-equinox/">Vice</a>)
        </blockquote>

        <p>As we covered in the last section, Joseph Smith was heavily involved in treasure digging and had begun these
            digs around 1822 according to Joseph Smith historian Dan Vogel’s timeline. This means that about a year into
            Joseph Smith’s treasure digging career, he began telling the story of the gold plates.</p>

        <p>
            This also makes sense given not just the autumnal equinox timing, but that Joseph Smith claimed to be
            visited by the guardian of the treasure, which was originally identified as an angel but was later
            retrofitted to Nephi and then Moroni. Furthermore, in Joseph Smith’s 1838 history he notes that the original
            story included three visits on the same night, which is another magical/occult belief that we mentioned in
            the last section – the power of three.

        <h3>The 1823 Attempt</h3>

        <p>
            Joseph Smith first went on September 22, 1823, the autumnal equinox, to retrieve the plates. According to
            his history, Joseph Smith claims he dug the hole where he was shown in a vision the plates would be and
            stated the following:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “Having removed the earth, I obtained a lever, which I got fixed under the edge of the stone, and with a
            little exertion raised it up. I looked in, and there indeed did I behold the plates, the Urim and Thummim,
            and the breastplate, as stated by the messenger. The box in which they lay was formed by laying stones
            together in some kind of cement. In the bottom of the box were laid two stones crossways of the box, and on
            these stones lay the plates and the other things with them.
            <br><br>
            I made an attempt to take them out, but was forbidden by the messenger, and was again informed that the time
            for bringing them forth had not yet arrived, neither would it, until four years from that time; but he told
            me that I should come to that place precisely in one year from that time, and that he would there meet with
            me, and that I should continue to do so until the time should come for obtaining the plates.” (<a
                href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1?lang=eng">Joseph Smith
                History</a>)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Keep in mind that Joseph Smith is writing his history in 1838 precisely to fight off the stories about his
            treasure digging that are swirling around, and in many instances do match the historical record. As we
            stated in our last section, the Urim and Thummim is a retrofitted term to the Book of Mormon as they were
            originally called spectacles or Nephite Interpreters.
        </p>

        <p>
            Furthermore, this is being written by Joseph Smith knowing the outcome of his story and the timeline is
            problematic as Joseph Smith did visit in 1824, but appears to give up the story until he picks it back up
            after his 1826 treasure digging trial. Joseph Smith's history also neglects to mention that the
            angel/guardian spirit told Joseph Smith to return a year later with the ‘right person’ who would be his
            oldest brother, Alvin, which we will see below.
        </p>

        <p>
            For this 1823 attempt, we do have some other sources who describe what Joseph Smith had told them of this
            dig. Oliver Cowdery wrote in his 1835 letters to W.W. Phelps, which are very interesting as it makes clear
            that the hill the plates came from is believed to clearly be the same Hill Cumorah as in the Book of Mormon,
            but also gives a description of the 1823 attempt to retrieve the plates.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “On attempting to take possession of the records [gold pates] a shock was produced upon his system, by an
            invisible power, which deprived him in a measure, of his natural strength. He desisted for an instant, and
            then made another attempt, but was more sensibly shocked than before. What was the occasion of this he knew
            not—there was the pure unsulied record, as had been described—he had heard of the power, of enchantment, and
            a thousand like stories, which held the hidden treasures of the earth, and sup[p]osed that physical exertion
            and personal strength was only necessary to enable him to yet obtain the object of his wish. He therefore
            made the third attempt with an increased exertion, when his strength failed him more than at either of the
            former times, and without premeditation he exclaimed, “why can I not obtained this book?” [“]because you
            have not kept the commandments of the Lord”, answered a voice, within a seeming short distance. He looked,
            and to his astonishment, there stood the angel who had previously given him the directions concerning this
            matter.” (<a
                href="https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/history-1834-1836/48#full-transcript">Oliver
                Cowdery Letter to W.W. Phelps</a>)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Again, we see all of the elements of treasure digging in this account: The treasure is taken back into the
            ground by the guardian spirit (referred to as an angel here, but not named), three attempts made to retrieve
            it (magical power of three), and a supernatural force prevented him from obtaining the treasure.
            <br><br>
            According to Joseph Knight, a faithful member of the church, once Joseph Smith was refused the gold plates,
            the Angel Moroni (guardian spirit) told Joseph Smith to come back on the next autumnal equinox and to bring
            his oldest brother, Alvin. From Joseph Knight:
            <br><br>
            "He [Joseph] exclaimed “why Cant I stur this Book?” And he was answered, “you have not Done rite; you should
            have took the Book and a gone right away. You cant have it now.” Joseph says, “when can I have it?” The
            answer was the 22nt Day of September next if you Bring the right person with you. Joseph says,” who is the
            right Person?” The answer was “your oldest Brother.”" (Joseph Knight, Reminiscences)
        </p>

        <h3>The 1824 Attempt</h3>

        <p>
            Just a few months after being told to bring his oldest brother Alvin in 1824 to retrieve the plates, Alvin
            passed away. According to Lucy Mack Smith, Alvin told Joseph to “do everything that lies in your power to
            obtain the Record. Be faithful in receiving instruction, and in keeping every commandment that is given
            you.” (Lucy Mack Smith, History of Joseph Smith, P. 87)
            <br><br>
            Joseph Smith went to the Hill Cumorah on the 1824 autumnal equinox (September 22) and failed again to get
            the plates as he did not bring Alvin as he had passed away the previous November. This is problematic since
            one would think an angel of the Lord would know Alvin was going to pass before the next autumnal equinox,
            but what is particularly interesting is that five days later, Joseph Smith Sr. posted a public notice in the
            Wayne Sentinel regarding Alvin’s body being removed from the grave.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/gold-plates-3.webp" alt="paper" class="image-style-4">
        </figure>


        <p>
            The notice states that rumors had been in circulation that Alvin Smith’s body had been dug up and
            “dissected,” and Joseph Smith Sr. and some of his neighbors went and dug up the grave to prove that the body
            was still there.
            <br><br>
            Historian Dan Vogel discussed this public notice and suggested that “Joseph Sr.’s explanation for
            disinterring Alvin’s body is questionable because one should have been able to determine if the grave had
            been disturbed without exhuming the body. It seems probable, therefore, that Joseph Sr. himself may have
            been the source of the rumor, that the story was a ruse to exhume Alvin’s body for its use in attempting to
            get the gold plates.” (Dan Vogel, The Making of a Prophet, p. 57)
            <br><br>
            There is no reason to doubt that Joseph Smith Sr. believed that Joseph Smith Jr. held the power to see
            buried treasure, and while it might seem insane today to think that he would exhume Alvin to retrieve the
            plates, if you live in a magical worldview where you believe your son that bringing Alvin was the
            requirement of the guardian spirit, you might just do it.
            <br><br>
            As Dan Vogel states, if Alvin’s grave had been recently exhumed, you would be able to tell without digging
            all the way to the body. While this story is of course circumstantial, Joseph Smith Sr.’s public notice
            gives clues as to what was happening with regards to the gold plates story in 1823-1824.
        </p>


        <h3>The Book of Mormon Spectacles</h3>

        <p>
            While Joseph Smith’s history claims that he visited the Hill Cumorah every year, there is no contemporary
            record that Joseph Smith visited the hill in 1825. During this time, Joseph Smith was heavily engaged in
            treasure digging, and according to historian Dan Vogel seemed to give it up the story of the gold plates
            after the 1824 attempt failed. (<a
                href="https://www.mormonstories.org/apologetics/book-of-mormon-dan-vogel/">Dan Vogel, Mormon
                Stories</a>)
            <br><br>
            Following the 1826 trial that we covered in the last section, Joseph Smith would more clearly understand the
            risk that treasure digging put him in given that it was illegal, and his father told him at the trial that
            he needed to use his power as God intended.
            <br><br>
            After that trial, Joseph Smith appeared to again focus on the gold plates and, along with the gold plates,
            Joseph Smith claimed to also receive two stones set in a bow similar to modern spectacles were . According
            to his mother, Lucy Mack Smith, this was the account after he claimed to retrieve the plates:
