        <h1>Book of Mormon Overview: Tight vs Loose Translation</h1>

        <p>
            In the past overviews, I have now covered Joseph Smith’s treasure digging, how that treasure digging
            influenced the story of the gold plates, and how Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon.
            <br><br>
            Following the translation, there are seven overviews on biblical scholarship and Mormonism along with
            overviews on the problems that arise from the loss of the 116 pages, DNA and the Book of Mormon, surrounding
            influences that find their way into the Book of Mormon, and how scholars can date the text by looking at
            anachronisms and problems within the text of the Book of Mormon.
            <br><br>
            If you’ve made it through those fourteen overviews, this section will hopefully help to begin tying it all
            back together. In this section I want to briefly examine the differences between the tight and loose
            translation theories for the Book of Mormon. This is important because some apologists will argue both
            theories, but as we will discuss below, it is impossible to switch between both a tight and loose
            translation, and the history is very clear that only a tight translation fits with accounts that we do have.
        </p>

        <h3>Definition of a Tight vs Loose Translation</h3>

        <p>
            For the purposes of this overview, I want to describe what I mean by “tight” and “loose” translation.
            <br><br>
            Before I give my definitions for the purpose of this overview, I want to give FAIR Mormon’s full (but
            incredibly short) write-up of the issue of tight vs loose translation theories:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            "​Was Joseph Smith provided with the exact wording of every sentence in the Book of Mormon? Was he simply
            given impressions which he then dictated within the context of his own understanding? Was it some
            combination of the two methods?
            <br><br>
            Joseph's wife Emma related her own experience:
            <br><br>
            "When my husband was translating the Book of Mormon, I wrote a part of it, as he dictated each sentence,
            word for word, and when he came to proper names he could not pronounce, or long words, he spelled them out,
            and while I was writing them, if I made a mistake in spelling, he would stop me and correct my spelling,
            although it was impossible for him to see how I was writing them down at the time. .?. . When he stopped for
            any purpose at any time he would, when he commenced again, begin where he left off without any hesitation,
            and one time while he was translating he stopped suddenly, pale as a sheet, and said, "Emma, did Jerusalem
            have walls around it?" When I answered, "Yes," he replied, "Oh! I was afraid I had been deceived." He had
            such a limited knowledge of history at the time that he did not even know that Jerusalem was surrounded by
            walls."
            <br><br>
            Scholars have examined and debated the issue of a "tight" versus "loose" translation method for many years.
            Although it is an interesting intellectual exercise, the exact process by which words and sentences were
            formed has no bearing upon the fact that the book was dictated by the "gift and power of God.""
            (<a
                href="https://www.fairlatterdaysaints.org/answers/index.php?title=Book_of_Mormon/Translation/Tight_versus_loose_translation&redirect=no">fairmormon.org</a>)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            There is a reason that FAIR Mormon is carefully avoiding taking a stand on tight or loose translation, and
            that is because they will often jump between the two depending on the problem that is presented for Joseph
            Smith and the Book of Mormon.
            <br><br>
            Now I want to give my definitions of the two methods here, which I think is fair to both the critic and
            apologist with regards to how this issue is framed.
        </p>

        <h3>Defining a tight vs loose translation</h3>

        <p>
            <strong>Tight translation:</strong> As outlined above by FAIR's use of Emma Smith’s quote above, a tight
            translation is where
            Joseph Smith is directly translating the Book of Mormon via the seer/peep stone in the hat word for word.
            The translation of the plates would appear on Joseph Smith’s seer/peep stone in the hat, and Joseph Smith
            would dictate them to his scribe. This method of translation is a literal one and does not afford Joseph
            Smith the ability to change or alter the words as the tight translation must be direct for the stone to
            reveal further words as we will see from the accounts of the translation.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Loose translation:</strong> This method of translation would give Joseph Smith "inspiration" through
            revelation,
            which allowed Joseph Smith the freedom to dictate the text of the Book of Mormon through his own milieu,
            putting the text of the Book of Mormon in his own words. Effectively Joseph Smith would be given the general
            lessons and concepts through revelations, but it was then left to Joseph Smith to weave those into a story
            that could be understood in his time. Some have argued that this would be a revelation of “pure
            intelligence” where Joseph Smith was flooded with the story itself, some say Joseph Smith could see the
            actual Book of Mormon events in visions, and some say he got literal translations but was then free to make
            changes as he saw fit.
        </p>

        <h3>What History Tells Us About the Translation Method</h3>

        <p>
            The history from Joseph Smith's time is very clear that a tight translation was used to produce the Book of
            Mormon. The quote from Emma Smith above leaves absolutely no room for a loose translation. The key part of
            her recollection:
            <br><br>
            "When my husband was translating the Book of Mormon, I wrote a part of it, as he dictated each sentence,
            word for word, and when he came to proper names he could not pronounce, or long words, he spelled them out,
            and while I was writing them, if I made a mistake in spelling, he would stop me and correct my spelling,
            although it was impossible for him to see how I was writing them down at the time."
            <br><br>
            If Emma’s account is not clear enough, the only other two accounts from the witnesses leave absolutely no
            doubt how Joseph Smith claimed to translate the Book of Mormon
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>David Whitmer wrote the following about the translation:</strong>
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “Joseph Smith would put the seer stone into a hat, and put his face in the hat, drawing it closely around
            his face to exclude the light; and in the darkness the spiritual light would shine. A piece of something
            resembling parchment would appear, and on that appeared the writing. One character at a time would appear,
            and under it was the interpretation in English. Brother Joseph would read off the English to Oliver Cowdery,
            who was his principal scribe, and when it was written down and repeated to Brother Joseph to see if it was
            correct, then it would disappear, and another character with the interpretation would appear." (David
            Whitmer, An Address to All Believers in Christ, Richmond, Mo.: n.p., 1887, p. 12.)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            <strong>Martin Harris described the translation process to Edward Stevenson,</strong>a member of the First
            Council of Seventy:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            Martin Harris related an incident that occurred during the time that he wrote that portion of the
            translation of the Book of Mormon which he was favored to write direct from the mouth of the Prophet Joseph
            Smith. He said that the Prophet possessed a seer stone, by which he was enabled to translate as well as from
            the Urim and Thummim, and for convenience he then used the seer stone, Martin explained the translation as
            follows: By aid of the seer stone, sentences would appear and were read by the Prophet and written by Martin
            and when finished he would say "Written," and if correctly written that sentence would disappear and another
            appear in its place, but if not written correctly it remained until corrected, so that the translation was
            just as it was engraven on the plates, precisely in the language then used." (<a
                href="http://books.google.com/books?id=u4xJAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA86&lpg=PA86&dq=%22Martin+Harris+related+an+incident+that+occurred%22">"One
                of the Three Witnesses,"
                Millennial Star, Volume 44, p 86-87</a>)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            None of these three accounts allow for a loose translation of the Book of Mormon, as the seer stone would
            not continue to reveal the words without the exact, correct words (and spelling) being dictated by not just
            Joseph Smith, but the scribe writing it down as intended. I want to be clear – there is absolutely no wiggle
            room that would allow for a loose translation in these accounts, and these are all people who were
            intimately involved with Joseph Smith during the translation process.
        </p>

        <h3>Why It Matters</h3>

        <p>
            As I’ve gone through these overviews, I have mentioned many times that we need to look at these problems in
            totality. The reason is that when you try and isolate every problem as the apologetic responses tend to do,
            it seems possible to make them go away or at least get you to put them back on the “shelf” for a later time.
            <br><br>
            But with the translation of the Book of Mormon, it is one of the most important aspects of Joseph Smith's
            history to understand the process of how the Book of Mormon was created. The reason this is so important to
            understand is that many apologists continue to lean on the loose translation theory when they have to
            address the many problems with the Book of Mormon, Book of Abraham, and Doctrine and Covenants.
            <br><br>
            Effectively a loose translation gives Joseph Smith a lot of wiggle room for errors, because it is the idea
            that Joseph Smith was inspired to write the general concepts in his own mindset which allows these problems
            to be brushed aside as a perfect gospel being filtered through an imperfect man.
            <br><br>
            However, the history tells us that a tight translation is the only translation method that fits. If you
            believe the witnesses, then there is no room for a loose translation, and this is a massive problem for
            Joseph Smith's credibility along with the Book of Mormon.
            <br><br>
            What I want to do below is to highlight the problems that simply cannot survive a tight translation, and as
            I mentioned them above I think this is where we can look at them in totality to understand why (non-LDS)
            scholars are not just certain that the Book of Mormon is not a historical text, but that Joseph Smith is the
            author of it.
        </p>

        <h3>Problems with the Book of Mormon that Cannot Survive a Tight Translation</h3>

        <h4>King James Bible Errors and Deutero-Isaiah</h4>

        <p>
            As we’ve covered to the point of exhaustion in these overviews, the Book of Mormon is literarily dependent
            on the King James Bible (KJV) throughout the text. The problem is that Joseph Smith copied the Bible
            chapters into the Book of Mormon, including many translation errors and italicized words in the process.
            This would not be possible with a direct translation from the seer stone as a tight translation requires. A
            very brief example of this problem can be found here:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            <strong>MALACHI 3:10 (KJV)</strong>: ...and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to
            receive it
            <br><br>
            <strong>3 NEPHI 24:10</strong>: ...and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to
            receive it
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            In this example, there are seven italicized words added to the KJV translations that are not in the original
            Hebrew manuscript. The Book of Mormon was supposedly written 1,400 years earlier and has the same exact
            additions as the KJV. That is impossible with a tight translation, and even with a loose translation leaves
            some huge problems to be addressed.
            <br><br>
            Our Deutero-Isaiah overview covers this in much more detail, but in those chapters Lehi would not have even
            had access to the source material before leaving Jerusalem. This is a problem in that it appears in the Book
            of Mormon not just in direct copying of the text, but also in the themes throughout.
            <br><br>
            Again, even with a loose translation, this is an absolutely critical issue with the Book of Mormon, and it
            is an area where we can show that Joseph Smith’s inability to know that there were multiple writers of
            Isaiah allows us today to see that it is not an ancient text.
            <br><br>
            This problem is even further complicated by the fact that Joseph Smith changed some of the King James
            Version passages while completing his Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible, yet has the original errors in
            the Book of Mormon. <br><br>
            Take the following example:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            <strong>3 NEPHI 13:25-27</strong>: 25 And now it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words he
            looked upon the
            twelve whom he had chosen, and said unto them: Remember the words which I have spoken. For behold, ye are
            they whom I have chosen to minister unto this people. Therefore I say unto you, take no thought for your
            life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the
            life more than meat, and the body than raiment?
            <br><br>
            26 Behold the fowls of the air, for they sow not, neither do they reap nor gather into barns; yet your
            heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?
            <br><br>
            27 Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?
            <br><br>
            <strong>MATTHEW 6:25-27 (KJV)</strong>: 25 Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye
            shall eat, or
            what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the
            body than raiment?
            <br><br>
            26 Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your
            heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?
            <br><br>
            27 Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?
            <br><br>
            <strong>MATTHEW 6:28-31(JST)</strong>: 28 Therefore, I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye
            shall eat or what
            ye shall drink, nor yet for your bodies, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body
            than raiment?
            <br><br>
            29 Behold the fowls of the air, for they sow not; neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your
            heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they? How much more will he not feed you?
            <br><br>
            30 Wherefore, take no thought for these things, but keep my commandments wherewith I have commanded you.
            <br><br>
            31 For which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            We are told the Book of Mormon is the most correct book on Earth, yet Joseph Smith claimed to have used
            revelation to change verses in the King James Version of the Bible that now differ from the Book or Mormon.
            Those are the examples that call into question the legitimacy of Joseph Smith's prophetic abilities,
            especially when understanding the translation method used in the Book of Mormon itself. Here is one more
            example where Joseph Smith 'corrected' a part of the King James Bible that he had copied directly into the
            Book of Mormon:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            <strong>3 Nephi 14:6</strong>: 6 Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls
            before swine, lest
            they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Matthew 7:6 (KJV)</strong>: 6 Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls
            before swine,
            lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Matthew 7:10-11 (JST)</strong>: 10 And the mysteries of the kingdom ye shall keep within yourselves;
            for it is not
            meet to give that which is holy unto the dogs; neither cast ye your pearls unto swine, lest they trample
            them under their feet.
            <br><br>
            11 For the world cannot receive that which ye, yourselves, are not able to bear; wherefore ye shall not give
            your pearls unto them, lest they turn again and rend you.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            There is no way to reconcile Joseph Smith copying directly from the King James Bible unless we accept a
            loose translation, but as stated above that contradicts what we know about the translation process from the
            witnesses. Emma Smith also noted that Joseph Smith never had any source material to copy from, yet we know
            without a shadow of a doubt that he copied from the King James Bible because of the added words that are
            unique to the KJV Bible. This is a problem that has never had a good answer without directly contradicting
            the statements of those involved in the process.
        </p>

        <h4>Anachronisms</h4>

        <p>
            As we covered in the last overview, one of the quickest and surest ways that scholars can assess the Book of
            Mormon is by looking at anachronisms. With a tight translation, there would be no way to have anachronisms
            such as the ones in the Book of Mormon that would be unfamiliar to Book of Mormon times, but entirely
            familiar to Joseph Smith. Again, remember that the witnesses all state that Joseph Smith saw the exact words
            and spelling on his stone in the hat, so anachronisms would not be possible under a tight translation.
            <br><br>
            Apologists claim that Joseph Smith used a loose translation when he came across an animal, material, or
            geographic area he was unfamiliar with, but that doesn't fit the translation history nor does it explain why
            Joseph Smith used words that have never been used elsewhere such as deseret, curelom, and cumom. Among the
            most common anachronisms are:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Elephants</li>
            <li>Cattle</li>
            <li>Sheep</li>
            <li>Goats</li>
            <li>Pigs</li>
            <li>Honey bees</li>
            <li>Horses</li>
            <li>Chariots</li>
            <li>Steel Swords</li>
            <li>Metal working</li>
            <li>Silk</li>
            <li>Wheat</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The problem is that Joseph Smith included all of these animals, items, and plants in the Book of Mormon that
            did not exist during the time it claims to have taken place in. Apologists fall back on a loose translation
            to say that Joseph Smith had to use words he was familiar with when he saw something he did not understand,
            but that is in direct contradiction with the tight translation as described by Emma Smith and David Whitmer.
            <br><br>
            Because of this, apologists move to a 'loan shifting' method of trying to explain that horses aren't horses,
            but maybe tapirs. Apologist Brant Gardner gives this explanation: "What we probably have in this case is
            Joseph substituting a known animal (out of place) for an animal which was also a big cat. In other words,
            the underlying text would have been 'jaguar' but the translation would be 'lion.'"
            <br><br>
            The problem is that this can only work with a very loose translation that would require Joseph to see the
            Book of Mormon story in a visionary state, which completely contradicts the very idea of translating gold
            plates. Or more to the point, if it was a tight translation Joseph Smith would simply use whatever word that
            God revealed to him, but with a loose translation Joseph Smith would see the 'big cat' in a vision and then
            plug it into what he sees it as in his inspired mind.
            Not only does this contradict the accounts we have, but it also creates other problems. Even if we accept
            Gardner’s explanation, we then have to explain how we got the words deseret, curelom, or cumom because no
            one had heard of them before or since.
            <br><br>
            But the bigger problem for Joseph Smith is that if he was truly translating the word of God, according to
            witness statements, he would have been given the correct, specific terms or else the next grouping or words
            would not appear on the stone in the hat. Either Joseph Smith was lying to those who were involved in the
            process to make it seem more magical, or the witnesses were all recounting an incorrect history
            independently of each other.
            <br><br>
            Given that Joseph Smith used the exact same method to translate the Book of Mormon as he did to “see” lost
            treasure buried in the ground for money, it would make sense that Joseph Smith was telling those around him
            a translation process that seemed magical while dictating the book orally to his scribe. We will get more
            into the process of how Joseph Smith wrote the Book of Mormon in the next section, but it absolutely ties in
            to the translation method as well.
        </p>

        <h4>Bible Stories Being Incorporated into the Book of Mormon as Literal Events</h4>

        <p>
            As we covered in our sections on biblical scholarship, the Book of Mormon incorporates the earliest stories
            of the Bible directly into the Book of Mormon as if they are literal, historical events. This becomes a
            problem as history has shown that many of them simply did not happen.
            <br><br>
            In the case of Adam and Eve, we can show that the story was a late addition when the Pentateuch was being
            officially composed, and we can show through science that neither the Tower of Babel or global flood are
            historical events. These three stories in Genesis are etiological myths, and in ancient times they were not
            meant to be a literal history as they did not view history as we do today.
            <br><br>
            However, all three stories are incorporated through the Book of Mormon to the point that if any of them are
            not historically true, the Book of Mormon cannot stand on its own. If the Book of Mormon is a historical
            record translated with a “tight translation,” there is absolutely no reason that the Tower of Babel story
            would be mentioned with the Jaredites because it never happened.
            <br><br>
            Again, this is where we can show that Joseph Smith was dictating the Book of Mormon and using the King James
            Bible as a source text. Unfortunately, it is by studying the Bible and the history behind it that we can
            show where Joseph Smith was pulling material that either did not happen historically or was not available
            during the times of the Book of Mormon.
            <br><br>
            If you have not read through our sections on biblical scholarship, please do so as I believe they are more
            important to understanding the historicity of the Book of Mormon than just about any other problem with the
            Book of Mormon itself.
        </p>

        <h4>Changes to the Book of Mormon</h4>

        <p>
            There have been over 100,000 changes to the Book of Mormon with most being grammatical changes, but also
            some pretty significant changes after the initial 1830 edition. Under a tight translation, these changes
            would be impossible to make because Joseph Smith would be changing the literal word of God, but even under a
            loose translation it begs the question of why Joseph Smith would need to go back and make significant
            changes to account for the evolving theology regarding the plurality of gods. For example:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            1 Nephi 11:18 (1830): "And he said unto me, Behold, the virgin which thou seest, is the mother of God, after
            the manner of the flesh."
            <br><br>
            1 Nephi 11:18 (Now): "And he said unto me: Behold, the virgin whom thou seest is the <strong>mother of the
                Son of
                God</strong>, after the manner of the flesh."
            <br><br>
            1 Nephi 11:21 (1830): "And the angel said unto me, behold the Lamb of God, yea, even the Eternal Father!"
            <br><br>
            1 Nephi 11:21 (Now): "And the angel said unto me: Behold the Lamb of God, yea, even the <strong>Son of the
                Eternal
                Father</strong>!"
            <br><br>
            1 Nephi 11:32 (1830): "And I looked and beheld the Lamb of God, that he was taken by the people; yea, the
            Everlasting God, was judged of the world"
            <br><br>
            1 Nephi 11:32 (Now): "And I looked and beheld the Lamb of God, that he was taken by the people; yea, the
            <strong>Son
                of the Everlasting God</strong>, was judged of the world"
            <br><br>
            1 Nephi 13:40 (1830): "and shall make known to all kindreds, tongues, and people, that the Lamb of God is
            the Eternal Father and the Savior of the world"
            <br><br>
            1 Nephi 13:40 (Now): "and shall make known to all kindreds, tongues, and people, that the Lamb of God is the
            <strong>Son of the Eternal Father</strong> and the Savior of the world"
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Apologists argue that Joseph Smith was merely adding words to avoid confusion for readers, but as we discuss
            in our First Vision overview, this timing lines up with the church's evolving theology regarding the
            plurality of gods. In addition, Joseph Smith makes other changes that would be impossible under the tight
            translation as history dictates:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            1 Nephi 20:1 (1830): "Hearken and hear this, O house of Jacob, which are called by the name of Israel, and
            are come forth out of the waters of Judah, which swear"
            <br><br>
            1 Nephi 20:1 (1864): "Hearken and hear this, O house of Jacob, who are called by the name of Israel, and are
            come forth out of the waters of Judah, or <strong>out of the waters of baptism</strong>, who swear"
            <br><br>
            Mosiah 21:28 (1830): "king Benjamin had a gift from God, whereby he could interpret such engravings;"
            <br><br>
            Mosiah 21:28 (Now): "king <strong>Mosiah</strong> had a gift from God, whereby he could interpret such
            engravings;"
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            These changes again would not be possible with a tight translation, because as we showed above the words on
            the stone would not move to the next words until they were written down correctly. This then requires a
            loose translation where Joseph Smith is given the freedom to make changes as he saw fit.
        </p>

        <h4>Surrounding Influences</h4>

        <p>
            As I covered in the overview on surrounding influences, Joseph Smith incorporates events that are going on
            around him into the Book of Mormon which simply would not be possible under a tight translation.
            <br><br>
            Joseph Smith references treasure digging at multiple points through the Book of Mormon, which would make no
            sense to those in the ancient Americas who did not practice treasure digging with ‘slippery’ treasures that
            sink into the ground.
            <br><br>
            The Charles Anthon visit by Martin Harris is written directly into the Book of Mormon after the visit
            occurred, thus fulfilling a prophecy in the Book of Mormon that had already happened. Again, this is not
            something that one can reasonably explain with a tight translation.
            <br><br>
            We also have Joseph Smith writing in his father’s dream as Lehi’s dream, writing in the translation process
            for the Book of Mormon, and even writing himself in as the seer who will bring forth the Book of Mormon.
            <br><br>
            Again, I highly recommend reading our surrounding influences overview, because there is absolutely no way to
            reconcile those influences appearing in the Book of Mormon with the translation accounts that we have from
            Emma Smith, Martin Harris, and David Whitmer.
        </p>

        <h4>The Lost 116 Pages</h4>

        <p>
            The "lost 116 pages” is an area that requires a loose translation, because if Joseph Smith was truly
            utilizing a tight translation there would have been no harm in re-translating the lost pages. As we covered
            in the lost 116 pages overview, Joseph Smith claimed to have lost access to translating the plates upon the
            pages being lost, and that God had revealed he could not re-translate as evil people would alter the
            handwritten words try to make him foolish.
            <br><br>
            That is a difficult idea to believe because if Joseph Smith had re-translated the 116 pages and then Lucy
            came back with altered pages, it would be extremely obvious that she had manually changed the original pages
            written on foolscap paper. While they did not have the forensic abilities we do now, trying to white-out and
            copy over a page to alter the text would be extremely obvious.
            <br><br>
            Put another way, in a tight translation method the words would be identical because the words on Joseph
            Smith's seer/peep stone did not change until they were both written down and spelled correctly. The tight
            translation method, which Joseph Smith claimed to those around him, is actually the perfect safety net for a
            situation such as this.
            <br><br>
            An apologetic argument might be that this is not a question or a tight or loose translation since God had
            prepared a second set of plates thousands of years earlier knowing that Joseph would lose those exact pages,
            but as we outline in our lost 116 pages overview, the problems with the 116 pages go well beyond the tight
            and loose translation issue.
        </p>

        <h3>Problems with the Book of Mormon that Cannot Survive a Loose Translation</h3>

        <p>Now that we’ve covered some of the key problems that cannot survive the Book of Mormon using a tight
            translation, I wanted to highlight a few that cannot survive a loose translation.</p>

        <h4>DNA and the Lamanites</h4>

        <p>
            As we explored in our overview on DNA and the Book of Mormon, we now know the Native Americans that the
            church has called the descendants of the Lamanites for the last 170+ years are not from Jerusalem, but from
            Asia. This has forced apologists to find new theories to explain how the entire Book of Mormon can be based
            on a premise that has been proven false by both migration studies and DNA testing that was not available to
            nor probably ever envisioned by Joseph Smith.
            <br><br>
            This is actually a problem no matter which translation method is used, because even a tight translation
            shows that the Lamanites aren't who we were told they were, but, more importantly, in a loose translation we
            can see that Joseph Smith was not able to weave the vision correctly to incorporate the kind of surrounding
            civilizations to make the story line up with history.
            <br><br>
            Apologists now claim that there were other populations here when the Jaredites arrived, but that is not
            mentioned anywhere in the Book of Mormon and church leaders have been quite clear that America had been
            preserved solely for this group to arrive, including an article by Jeffrey R. Holland making that quite
            clear. From Holland:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “Such a special place needed now to be kept apart from other regions, free from the indiscriminate traveler
            as well as the soldier of fortune. To guarantee such sanctity the very surface of the earth was rent. In
            response to God’s decree, the great continents separated and the ocean rushed in to surround them. The
            promised place was set apart. Without habitation it waited for the fulfillment of God’s special purposes.”
            (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1976/06/a-promised-land?lang=eng">A Promised
                Land, Jeffrey R. Holland</a>)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            A loose translation would also explain why the Book of Mormon makes the Lamanites are described just like
            the Indians of Joseph Smith's times were perceived, but does not allow for the idea that the Americas were
            heavily populated when the Book of Mormon people arrived (Jaredites or Lehites). If you believe that Joseph
            received the Book of Mormon story through prophetic vision, you could attempt to explain away the need for
            the gold plates, but then it calls into question how Joseph got so much wrong about that time period while
            looking directly at visionary images through the power of God.
        </p>

        <h4>Hebraisms</h4>

        <p>
            One of the areas of 'evidence' that apologists claim for the Book of Mormon is the use of Hebraisms -
            specifically chiasmus. This would require a tight translation, because not only does the language have to be
            perfectly translated from the records, but the sentence structure would have to be preserved as well. There
            is no way to reconcile a loose translation with chiasmus as evidence for the Book of Mormon being an ancient
            text, although there are many works that have chiasmus from Joseph Smith's time and afterwards that are not
            scriptures such as The Late War, which was written in a style of King James English and available to Joseph
            Smith growing up.
            <br><br>
            This is important to note because a large problem with the loose translation theory as a whole is that the
            plates were never used, so if Joseph was writing through revelation (as opposed to translation), how would
            he know to use chiasmus in these visions? On the other hand, if Joseph was using a tight translation which
            would bring us chiasmus, it opens the door to all of the other problems with the Book of Mormon we listed
            above.
            <br><br>
            In other words, the Hebraisms have to be the result of a tight translation that preserves the sentence and
            grammatical structure of ancient times, but the moment you then cite them as evidence, you have to answer
            all of the problems that simply cannot exist with a tight translation. That is where this problem becomes
            very tricky to deal with.
        </p>

        <h4>New Names of Plants, Animals, and Money</h4>

        <p>
            This might go without saying, but if Joseph Smith was using a loose translation where he applied his own
            vocabulary for everything he saw in a visionary state, then where did the terms he created within the Book
            of Mormon come from?
            <br><br>
            The Book of Mormon introduces new words for animal (“curelom” and “cumom”), plants (“neas” and “sheum”),
            metal (“ziff”), and monetary units (“senine,” “seon,” “shum,” “limnah,” “senum,” “amnor,” “ezrom,” “onti,”
            “shiblon,” and “leah”) throughout the text. In addition you have words like "liahona" and "deseret" which
            have no ancient or modern connection even though both of those words are frequently used in church
            materials.
            <br><br>
            In a loose translation, the only way these words could appear is if Joseph Smith simply made them up. An
            apologetic response would be that Joseph Smith was given these specific names during the visionary or
            revelatory process, but then you would have to answer why Joseph Smith was not given the correct names for
            everything else that is now know as an anachronism that is listed above.
            <br><br>
            Put another way, if the apologetic response is that Joseph Smith saw an animal so unique that he couldn’t
            name it “bear” or “turkey” so the vision told him it was a “curelom,” then we have to explain why Joseph
            Smith did not get the correct names for animals that we are told must have looked like horses, elephants, or
            sheep.
            <br><br>
            This is an area where you need to have both a loose and tight translation method, but the history and
            accounts tell us that Joseph Smith cannot have it both ways. In this case, we can illustrate this problem
            with a single verse from Ether:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            Ether 9:19 “And they also had horses, and asses, and there were elephants and cureloms and cumoms; all of
            which were useful unto man, and more especially the elephants and cureloms and cumoms.”
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            It becomes very difficult to argue that Joseph Smith could switch between a tight and loose translation when
            a single verse in the Book of Mormon requires both methods of translation. If Joseph Smith was translating
            directly off the gold plates, you would not have the anachronistic words horses, asses, and elephants. On
            the other hand, if it was a loose translation that allowed Joseph Smith to see animals in a vision, you
            would not have made up words such as cureloms and cumoms. In this single verse, however, you need both a
            tight and loose translation to make it work, and that is highly problematic given the accounts that we do
            have for the translation process.

        <h3>Summary</h3>

        <p>
            The tight vs loose translation theories will continue to be a point of contention going forward, but as I
            stated at the beginning, the history is very clear that Joseph Smith used a tight translation process for
            the Book of Mormon. There is absolutely no way to reconcile the idea of a loose translation with the history
            from Emma Smith, Martin Harris, and David Whitmer. I do not want to belabor the point, but here are the
            accounts from Emma Smith, David Whitmer, and Martin Harris again:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            Emma Smith: "As he dictated each sentence, word for word, and when he came to proper names he could not
            pronounce, or long words, he spelled them out, and while I was writing them, if I made a mistake in
            spelling, he would stop me and correct my spelling, although it was impossible for him to see how I was
            writing them down at the time... When he stopped for any purpose at any time he would, when he commenced
            again, begin where he left off without any hesitation." (Edmund C. Briggs, “A Visit to Nauvoo in 1856,”
            Journal of History, Jan. 1916, p. 454.)
            <br><br>
            David Whitmer: “Joseph Smith would put the seer stone into a hat, and put his face in the hat, drawing it
            closely around his face to exclude the light; and in the darkness the spiritual light would shine. A piece
            of something resembling parchment would appear, and on that appeared the writing. One character at a time
            would appear, and under it was the interpretation in English. Brother Joseph would read off the English to
            Oliver Cowdery, who was his principal scribe, and when it was written down and repeated to Brother Joseph to
            see if it was correct, then it would disappear, and another character with the interpretation would appear."
            (David Whitmer, An Address to All Believers in Christ, Richmond, Mo.: n.p., 1887, p. 12.)
            <br><br>
            Martin Harris's Account via Edward Stevenson: "Martin Harris related an incident that occurred during the
            time that he wrote that portion of the translation of the Book of Mormon which he was favored to write
            direct from the mouth of the Prophet Joseph Smith. He said that the Prophet possessed a seer stone, by which
            he was enabled to translate as well as from the Urim and Thummim, and for convenience he then used the seer
            stone, Martin explained the translation as follows: By aid of the seer stone, sentences would appear and
            were read by the Prophet and written by Martin and when finished he would say "Written," and if correctly
            written that sentence would disappear and another appear in its place, but if not written correctly it
            remained until corrected, so that the translation was just as it was engraven on the plates, precisely in
            the language then used." (<a
                href="http://books.google.com/books?id=u4xJAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA86&lpg=PA86&dq=%22Martin+Harris+related+an+incident+that+occurred%22">"One
                of the Three Witnesses," Millennial Star, Volume 44, p 86-87</a>)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This presents massive problems for the credibility and authenticity of the Book of Mormon as outlined by the
            different issues above. Joseph Smith unquestionably used the King James Bible as source material while the
            Book of Mormon was being written, which is impossible under a tight translation method. If Joseph Smith put
            his seer/peep stone and hat down when he recognized that he was dictating parts of Isaiah and just grabbed
            his copy of the King James Bible, by his own account the stone would not just pick up where he left off
            unless the preceeding text was exactly correct.
            <br><br>
            Furthermore, Joseph Smith incorporates Bible stories as literal events which we now know did not happen in a
            literal sense, including Adam and Eve, the Tower of Babel, and a global flood. This becomes a problem with
            either translation method, but is especially damning for a tight translation since there would be no room
            for Joseph Smith to incorporate his own worldview that these were literal events into the text.
            <br><br>
            The anachronisms in the Book of Mormon require a loose translation to try and explain why Joseph Smith
            constantly relied on animals, plants, and metalworking that just did not exist in Book of Mormon times but
            ones that Joseph was familiar with from his own milieu and study of the Bible. A loose translation is also
            required to account for the changes made to the Book of Mormon - especially given the historical account
            from Emma that even spelling errors would keep the seer stone from revealing new words in Joseph's hat.
            <br><br>
            While the tight vs loose translation theories might seem like nitpicking at this point, it is very important
            to understanding that not only is the Book of Mormon not historical, but that Joseph Smith was the author.
            In order to even attempt to make the problems above seem plausible, apologists have to switch between the
            tight and loose translations depending on the problem. However, this not only is contradicted by the
            accounts we have from Emma Smith, David Whitmer, and Martin Harris, but shows an inconsistency in the
            translation process that gives us insight into how Joseph Smith created the text.
            <br><br>
            One last note I want to make here is that the loose translation theory did not become popularized until
            apologetics were forced to make the change. This is the same problem we saw with the Book of Abraham: Once
            the source papyrus for the Book of Abraham was recovered, there was no doubt that Joseph Smith got the
            translation completely wrong. At that point the church switched from a literal translation of Egyptian to a
            “catalyst theory,” which is the exact same idea of the loose translation.
            <br><br>
            In other words, for both the Book of Mormon and Book of Abraham we are no longer told that Joseph Smith was
            able to translate ancient languages, but that he was given revelatory and visionary experiences by God and
            then he filtered them through his own abilities to put them into words.
            <br><br>
            On one hand, this helps to explain away errors by attributing them to the errors of man. On the other hand,
            this method is indistinguishable from outright fraud, which is why church leaders were unwilling to make
            this shift until the evidence became too overwhelming to ignore. As Elder Ulisses Soares conceded in his
            April 2020 talk:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “This sacred ancient record was not ‘translated’ in the traditional way that scholars would translate
            ancient texts by learning an ancient language. We ought to look at the process more like a ‘revelation’ with
            the aid of physical instruments provided by the Lord as opposed to a ‘translation’ by one with knowledge of
            languages.”
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            To say that this is a completely different explanation of the Book of Mormon than I was given as an
            investigator 25 years ago is an understatement, but it shows how the church realizes that the idea of a
            tight translation is impossible to defend against the evidence.
            <br><br>
            And that leaves the church with a loose translation theory, which is disputed by the historical accounts in
            every sense and is no different than outright fraud. This is a problem that doesn’t really fully materialize
            until you take everything in totality, and that is why this is now the fifteenth overview page on the Book
            of Mormon on this site between biblical scholarship and the Book of Mormon itself.
            <br><br>
            As I’ve said on many of these overview pages, it is important to look at these topics in totality to
            understand why scholars can state with certainty that the Book of Mormon is not an ancient text, but a 19th
            century production by Joseph Smith. From Joseph Smith's days as a treasure digger until this section on the
            tight vs loose translation methods, all of the overviews help to connect the dots on how Joseph Smith was
            able to do it.
