        <h1>About That "Seer Stone Video" (June 26, 2019)</h1>

        <p>
            On June 24th, the LDS Church released a new, brief video on seer stones, marking a step forward in their
            effort to be more transparent about the Book of Mormon translation. If you haven’t seen it, the Church has
            published it on YouTube, and you can view it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1esI8cbCtc">here</a>.
            <br><br>
            While the video is short and doesn't require extensive discussion, I want to highlight how the Church
            continues to dodge and skirt around difficult issues, all while attempting to inoculate members against
            troubling historical topics.
            <br><br>
            Similar to the <em>Saints</em> book, the Church employs vague language and imagery, avoiding substantial
            details
            about the Book of Mormon translation beyond the most basic concepts. Additionally, the video uses a simple
            art style that downplays the available information about the translation process, keeping the presentation
            light and faith-promoting.
            <br><br>
            Below, I’ve included the text from the video with commentary on why the Church is still being misleading
            about the Book of Mormon translation, even in 2019, despite the information being so readily accessible. If
            you haven't read our annotated LDS Gospel Topics Essay on the Book of Mormon translation, I highly recommend
            it, as it provides far more detailed information than this blog post. From the video:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            "Seer stones are, well, stones, rocks. They are just one example of many physical objects which God has used
            through his spokesmen called prophets to demonstrate His power and to bless or communicate with His
            children. Let's look at some examples. You may remember from the Bible God commanded Moses to place a
            serpent made of brass on a pole to heal the children of Israel. He told Moses anyone who looketh upon it
            shall live. But the power to heal was not in the serpent or the pole - it was God's power. As another
            example, Moses used a rod, a large stick to part the Red Sea. The savior healed a woman who touched His
            garment and Jesus even used mud when He healed a blind man. Through examples such as these, we can see how
            God sometimes uses objects that people are familiar with to communicate with and bless His children."
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Apologists have long tried to "normalize" seer stones, because, at the end of the day, the idea of
            translating the Book of Mormon with a rock in a hat doesn’t make sense. The traditional translation story
            has always involved the use of the gold plates. This recent concession that Joseph Smith did use a "rock in
            a hat" contradicts the narrative the church taught me as a convert (and to everyone else) about Joseph Smith
            translating the gold plates studiously with special glasses to interpret the words.
            <br><br>
            The issue with the church’s attempt to create equivalence here is significant. Moses never used a rod to
            seek treasure for payment before using it to part the Red Sea. Moses never took money from innocent people
            to dig into hills, claiming that there was power in the brass serpent, found nothing, and then used it to
            translate "gold plates" containing scripture.
            <br><br>
            The church briefly mentions that Joseph Smith believed in seer stones, but they do not acknowledge that he
            used the same stone to search for buried treasure that he used to translate the Book of Mormon. While God
            did use ordinary people for extraordinary things in the Bible, Joseph Smith took money from people to locate
            hidden treasure or objects, failing every time to find anything. This cannot be overstated—he used the same
            stone to defraud people as he later did to translate the Book of Mormon.
            <br><br>
            To put it another way: if God was preparing Joseph by giving him a seer stone, why did he never find
            anything? If this was truly training, as LDS historian Richard Bushman theorizes, why did Joseph Smith never
            succeed or provide any evidence that the stone had supernatural powers? There’s a reason the church omits
            this information, and it’s a part of Joseph Smith’s history that they cannot avoid forever.
            <br><br>
            Back to the video:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            "So what are seer stones? Well, first, let's explain the word seer. A seer is literally a see-er - a person
            who sees. A seer is a spokesman called by God, a prophet who receives divine messages from God for the
            benefit of all God's children. At times, God has used seer stones to communicate to his prophets. It may
            seem odd to us today, but reference to a similar practice can be found in the Old Testament. Aaron, Moses'
            brother and the high priest, was instructed to carry a special instrument while in the temple. The Book of
            Exodus calls this instrument the Urim and Thummim: "And thou shalt put in the breastplate of judgment the
            Urim and the Thummim; and they shall be upon Aaron's heart when he goeth in before the Lord." The Urim and
            Thummim may have been similar to a pair of seer stones."
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Again, we cover all of this a lot more in-depth in the annotated LDS essay on the Book of Mormon
            translation, but the Urim and Thummim did not translate anything - they were not seer stones in the way
            Joseph Smith claimed to use them. They worked more like a magic 8-ball, only giving you answers of yes or
            no. The black stone translates to 'Yes' and the white stone translates to 'No' for questions the high
            priests would ask. They did not have the ability to find hidden objects or to project translated words from
            golden plates that were not even in the room with Joseph at the time he was using the stone in a hat.

        <figcaption>Ancient stones used in Hebrew divination, symbolizing 'Yes' or 'No' responses</figcaption>

        <p>
            Furthermore, the term 'Urim and Thummim' was not used to describe the 'seer stone' or any translation
            process of the Book of Mormon until W.W. Phelps introduced it in 1833. Initially, Joseph Smith referred to
            using Nephite Interpreters, but these were taken from him when he lost the first 116 pages. After resuming
            translation, Joseph switched to using a stone in a hat, as described by both Emma Smith and David Whitmer,
            for the version of the Book of Mormon that we have today.
            <br><br>
            The church, as well as those compiling this information, are fully aware of these details. However, they
            continue to blur the lines by using the term 'Urim and Thummim' interchangeably, despite the fact that the
            original Urim and Thummim in the Bible had nothing to do with translating ancient texts or receiving
            revelations—it was merely a tool for determining a yes-or-no answer to a question.
            <br><br>
            Back to the video:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            "The use of seer stones was also part of the common culture of 19th century Europe. It was believed that
            some people could use them to find lost objects or to see things not visible with the natural eye. This
            European cultural tradition was carried over to New England and became part of early American culture as
            well. In the early 19th century, during a time of religious fervour, Joseph Smith, a young man in upstate
            New York, believed in this practice. In his teenage years, Joseph sometimes used a seer stone to locate lost
            objects."
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            The problem is that a lot of people in the 19th century had a magical worldview, and many people did believe
            you could find lost objects with a rock, but that doesn't mean they were able to find them. Joseph Smith's
            entire family held this folk magic worldview, and Joseph Smith used this belief to earn money looking for
            objects for people who believed Joseph had a real gift.
            <br><br>
            But Joseph Smith never found anything during these digs, and the church neglects to mention this or the fact
            that he took money to look for these objects, even though he never actually found anything. The reason this
            information is left out of the video is simple: If Joseph Smith told people he could see objects with this
            stone even though he never could get them, why should we believe he was able to translate the Book of Mormon
            using the same exact method?
            <br><br>
            Again, look at this line from the video: "In his teenage years, Joseph sometimes used a seer stone to locate
            lost objects." This sentence implies that Joseph had at least some success using the seer stone to locate
            objects, but as we now know, Joseph Smith never found hidden objects for the people paying for his services.
            As most treasure digging stories would go, Joseph would claim to see the object deep in a hill, but as soon
            as the diggers would get close the treasure would 'slip away' never to be recovered. Interestingly enough
            there are elements of this worldview of Joseph's in the Book of Mormon.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            "And behold, the time cometh that he curseth your riches, that they become slippery, that ye cannot hold
            them; and in the days of your poverty ye cannot retain them....Yea, we have hid up our treasures and they
            have slipped away from us, because of the curse of the land....Yea, in that day ye shall say: O that we had
            remembered the Lord our God in the day that he gave us our riches, and then they would not have become
            slippery that we should lose them; for behold, our riches are gone from us." (Helaman 13)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Compare that passage from Helaman 13 with this account of treasure digging from Martin Harris:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “Three of us took some tools to go to the hill and hunt for more boxes of gold or something, and indeed we
            found a stone box. We got quite excited about it and dug carefully around it, and by some unseen power it
            slipped back into the hill. We stood there and looked at it and one of us took a crow-bar and tried to drive
            it through the lid and hold it, but the bar glanced off and broke off one of the corners of the box.
            Sometime that box will be found and you will see the corner broken off, and then you will know I have told
            you the truth." (The Last Testimony of Martin Harris, E. Cecil McGavin in The Instructor, October 1930, Vol
            65, No 10, pp 587-589)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            There are many instances where you can see Joseph Smith's own life experiences making their way into the
            Book of Mormon, and the use of stones and treasuring digging are both written into the book just as Joseph
            Smith had been participating in those ideas himself.

        <p>
            The church here is attempting to normalize treasure seeking (although they dance around calling it what it
            is) in order to avoid the really difficult problem of Joseph Smith having made money seeking treasure with
            the same stone that translated the Book of Mormon. This graphic implies that it was as simple as looking at
            a stone to find treasure, but they don't highlight Joseph sticking his head in a hat nor the massive digs in
            hills looking for items that would slip away as Joseph told the diggers they were getting close.
            <br><br>
            An important element the church also neglects to mention is that this was an <strong>illegal</strong>
            practice. Joseph Smith
            actually put on trial in 1826 for "glass looking," and you can find a ton of information about that trial
            from Dan Vogel's videos about it. You can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlPR2qeahOY">Part
                1: The Trial</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJRrCL_acMs">Part 2: The Verdict</a>.
            While there may
            have been many people who believed in folk magic and treasure digging, it was not common to the point where
            it was accepted by the general public nor was it common enough to be legal. Just as with polygamy, the
            church has to sidestep the very basic fact that Joseph Smith was breaking the law, and in this case was
            doing so in order to get the money of others in order to look for objects he was never going to find.
            <br><br>
            The church then transitions from the idea that it was "common" for people to seek treasure with stones to
            Joseph translating the Book of Mormon with his stone. From the video:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            "Later, God called Joseph as His prophet and provided him with a Urim and Thummim to translate an ancient
            book of scripture, The Book of Mormon - another testament of Jesus Christ. Many centuries earlier, this
            ancient record was engraved on gold plates in a language called Reformed Egyptian. Joseph used both the Urim
            and Thummim and a seer stone at different times during the translation process regarding the seer stone.
            Witnesses to the translation process said Joseph placed a stone and a hat in an effort to block out extra
            light and focus his attention. They reported that as he looked at the stone, he could see the translation,
            which he would then dictate, to a scribe. Miraculous!"
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            As we noted earlier, the term Urim and Thummim was never used until 1833 and is not even a correct use of
            the term here. Additionally, the seer stone was the only item that Joseph used for the Book of Mormon as we
            have it according to the statements of the witnesses, and the accounts of "spectacles" or "Nephite
            Interpreters" vary greatly and are contradictory. For more information on the problems with Joseph having a
            translating object that was not the stone (spectacles or breastplate), I again refer you to our annotated
            translation essay.
            <br><br>
            It also needs to be made clear that the stone Joseph Smith used was not given to him by God with the plates
            - it was found while digging either a well or looking for treasure on behalf of Willard Chase. From a 2009
            <a
                href="https://www.deseret.com/2009/11/23/20354481/challenging-issues-keeping-the-faith-how-a-seer-stone-helped-in-the-book-of-mormon-translation/">Deseret
                News article</a>:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            "In approximately 1819, Joseph borrowed a seer stone from a friend to find another whitish seer stone in an
            iron kettle 25 feet underground. Then, in 1822, Joseph found a brown stone while digging a well for Willard
            Chase."
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Willard Chase tells this story a bit differently, claiming that Joseph promised to return the brown stone
            that he would later use to translate the Book of Mormon, only to refuse to give it back. From Willard
            Chase's 1833 testimony:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            In the year 1822, I was engaged in digging a well. I employed Alvin and Joseph Smith... We discovered a
            singularly appearing stone... Joseph put it into his hat, and then his face into the top of his hat.
            <br><br>
            After obtaining the stone, he began to publish abroad what wonders he could discover by looking in it... I
            ordered the stone to be returned to me again. He had it in his possession about two years.
            <br><br>
            Some time in 1825, Hiram came to me, and wished to borrow the same stone... I told him if he would pledge me
            his word and honor, that I should have it when called for, he might take it...
            <br><br>
            In the fall of 1826, a friend called upon me and wished to see that stone... On going to Smith's, and asking
            him for the stone, he said, "you cannot have it;" I told him it belonged to me, repeated to him the promise
            he made me, at the time of obtaining the stone: upon which he faced me with a malignant look and said, "I
            don't care who in the Devil it belongs to, you shall not have it."
            <a href="https://richkelsey.org/willard-chase-account/">(Willard Chase Account)</a>
        </blockquote>

        <p>This part of the video does briefly mentions the gold plates, but again we have to ask why there would even
            be gold plates if Joseph Smith never actually used them in the translation. That is quite a departure from
            the LDS narrative that lasted until the internet and South Park made it impossible to continue ignoring how
            the translation was done. In the image below, you can see how the church portrayed the translation on the
            left, and how history tells us it happened on the right.</p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/translation-1.webp" alt="translation process" class="image-style-medium">

        <figcaption>Left: Joseph Smith wearing glasses and vest at his desk.
            Right: Joseph Smith with his head resting on a hat.</figcaption>

        <p>
            I know it feels like we're beating a dead horse, but the church using very simple graphics here again allows
            them to avoid showing just how bizarre the true translation would look. But the reality is that this is how
            Joseph Smith used the stone. From David Whitmer:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            "I will now give you a description of the manner in which the Book of Mormon was translated. Joseph
            Smith would put the seer stone into a hat, and put his face in the hat, drawing it closely around his face
            to exclude the light; and in the darkness the spiritual light would shine. A piece of something resembling
            parchment would appear, and on that appeared the writing. One character at a time would appear, and under it
            was the interpretation in English. Brother Joseph would read off the English to Oliver Cowdery, who was his
            principal scribe, and when it was written down and repeated to Brother Joseph to see if it was correct, then
            it would disappear, and another character with the interpretation would appear. Thus the Book of Mormon was
            translated by the gift and power of God, and not by any power of man.
            <br><br>
            I, as well as all of my father's family, Smith's wife, Oliver Cowdery and Martin Harris, were present during
            the translation... He [Joseph Smith] did not use the plates in translation." (Whitmer, An Address to All
            Believers in Christ, Part First, Chapter 1)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Compare that description with the depiction from the LDS seer stone video:
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/seer-stone-video-1.webp" alt="screenshot" class="image-style-medium">
        </figure>

        <p>
            While it might seem like we are nitpicking here, the truth is that the depiction in the video doesn't show
            Joseph drawing the face around closely to exclude all light. Furthermore, the video finally admits the
            statements of the witnesses are correct regarding how the Book of Mormon was translated, but do not explain
            why Joseph Smith included so many passages from the King James Version of the Bible, which could not have
            possibly been on the gold plates. In addition, Joseph Smith used many New Testament phrases and themes,
            which could not have been known by the Book of Mormon people, and verses from Deutero-Isaiah, written after
            Lehi left for America.
            <br><br>
            This part also discusses Reformed Egyptian, which is another big issue I have with the video. We have
            characters from the gold plates that Joseph had written down, yet the video only shows scribbles made to
            look much more authentic. Below you can see the characters shown in the video against the characters that
            were written down from the plates:
        </p>

        <img src="images/translation-7.webp" alt="Now you now video" class="image-style-big">

        <p>
            The problem with Reformed Egyptian is that there is no evidence that it has ever existed, and Joseph Smith's
            "Caractors" closely resemble the same letters, numbers, and symbols from Joseph Smith's time (i.e. modified
            English). But at the same time, why would the church create new characters of Reformed Egyptian when we have
            actual characters copied down by Joseph? The reason is that anyone who studies languages (or just looks at
            them carefully) knows exactly what Joseph Smith was doing here, and it doesn't take much work to make it
            crystal clear (image below from the Tanners):
        </p>

        <img src="images/translation-6.webp" alt="Sandra and Jerald Tanner's image" class="image-style-medium">


        <p>

            It is clear that the audience for this video is believing members, but it is frustrating that just like the
            recent Saints book, the church continues to leave out so much important evidence and context in order to
            give plausibility that these difficult issues can be resolved in a faith promoting manner.
            <br><br>
            I want to repeat one section from the video just for emphasis:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            "Joseph used both the Urim and Thummim and a seer stone at different times during the translation process.
            Regarding the seer stone, witnesses to the translation process said Joseph placed a stone and a hat in an
            effort to block out extra light and focus his attention. They reported that as he looked at the stone, he
            could see the translation, which he would then dictate, to a scribe. Miraculous!"
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            As we discuss in more detail in our annotated essay, this is a very careful way of trying to avoid saying
            that Joseph Smith used the seer stone exclusively for the Book of Mormon as we have it today. Furthermore,
            the account here by the church of the translation process opens up a lot of problems with the Book of Mormon
            because of KJV errors, New Testament phrases and themes, anachronisms, and more. You can read more about the
            problems that come with a tight translation theory here, because apologists need it both ways in order to
            even have a chance of making this work against the evidence.
            <br><br>
            That brings us to the last part of the video:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            "After the translation of the Book of Mormon as his spiritual abilities matured, Joseph found he no longer
            needed the aid of physical objects to receive revelation. The objects had served their purpose. There was
            never anything extraordinary about the seer stones any more than there was anything extraordinary about the
            brass serpent or rods or garments or mud. All were common everyday objects familiar to the people at the
            time, which God used to assist in producing miraculous results. God loves all his children and sometimes
            uses physical objects, including seer stones, to bring them to a knowledge of Jesus Christ and accomplish
            his work. Seer stones, their purpose and function. Now, you know."
        </blockquote>


        <p>
            One interesting point here is that Joseph Smith used a seer stone to receive early revelations. There was
            even an incident where Hiram Page claimed to receive revelations through his own seer stone. Upon learning
            this, Joseph quickly received a revelation that Hiram's revelations were from the adversary, and Hiram's
            stone was subsequently destroyed. In fact, even Oliver Cowdery and the Whitmers believed Hiram, which
            demonstrates how easily these men could be influenced by the folk magic beliefs of their time. You can read
            more about Hiram Page's seer stone in our Chapter 9 review of Saints.
            <br><br>
            We recently wrote about the process of D&C 132 being recorded and how Hyrum Smith asked Joseph to use the
            seer stone to receive the revelation on polygamy. Joseph responded that he no longer needed the stone, as he
            already knew D&C 132 perfectly. When you read D&C 132 with the understanding that Joseph did not use the
            seer stone, it is intriguing how the style matches other revelations that Joseph claimed to have received
            through the stone, using similar divine phrases and language.
            <br><br>
            Additionally, we know that Joseph Smith did not use the seer stone when translating the Book of Abraham, nor
            did he use it when writing the Book of Moses. However, the translation of the Book of Abraham has been found
            to be incorrect in nearly every aspect by Egyptologists. Similarly, the Book of Moses contains numerous
            issues, as highlighted by Biblical scholar and former Mormon, David Bokovoy, in a recent Mormon Stories
            podcast <a
                href="https://www.mormonstories.org/faith-crisis-stories/applying-higher-criticism-to-mormon-scripture-david-bokovoy/">(1019-1022:

            This post ended up being longer than anticipated, and we didn't even fully explore the changing narrative
            around the Book of Mormon translation. It's fascinating to compare how the church describes the translation
            process today, given the widespread availability of information on Mormon truth claims online, to how it was
            taught to me as a convert 20 years ago.
            <br><br>
            If this topic interests you, I encourage you to read our annotated LDS essay on the Book of Mormon
            translation. In it, we examine the problems surrounding the seer stone, the folk magic and occult influences
            in Joseph's account of receiving the plates, and the "miraculous" claims regarding Joseph Smith and the Book
            of Mormon.
            <br><br>
            These new efforts by the church seem to be aimed at gradually inoculating members against these difficult
            issues. However, if members take the next step and research these topics using non-correlated sources, the
            sense of having been misled by the church and its leaders will only deepen. The appeal to authority at the
            end of "Now you know" is especially jarring, considering the church had access to this information all along
            but only disclosed it when forced by the internet.
            <br><br>
            The video in question carefully avoids addressing Joseph Smith's treasure-digging past, fails to show an
            actual image of the seer stone, doesn't display the 'Reformed Egyptian' characters that Joseph wrote down
            (instead fabricating more plausible ones), implies that seer stones were "common" as if that lends them
            credibility, and uses simple graphics to avoid depicting how strange it would appear for Joseph to translate
            words from golden plates (which were either hidden in another room or buried underground) by sticking his
            head in a hat.
            <br><br>
            The church will likely continue releasing these videos along with new efforts to slowly introduce members to
            these challenging topics through soft narratives like Saints. However, the evidence against their truth
            claims is overwhelming. While the Book of Mormon translation poses significant problems for the church's
            truth claims, the DNA evidence related to the Book of Mormon is even more conclusive, and defending the Book
            of Abraham is an indefensible position.
            <br><br>
            One final thought: If the church were genuinely interested in telling their history honestly and not hiding
            information from members, why was South Park telling the truth about the Book of Mormon translation before
            the church? The image below contrasts the South Park depiction of the translation process from 2003 with the
            official church depiction in the Joseph Smith movie, shown at visitors centers and released in 2005.

            We've mentioned on many other posts how difficult it is to take in this new information, and we understand
            how painful it is to process. Please email us anytime at ldsdiscussion@gmail.com if you would like more
            resources to learn about these issues or if you are looking for people that you can safely talk to as you
