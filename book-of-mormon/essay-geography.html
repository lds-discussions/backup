        <h1>Annotated Analysis of the Official LDS Essay on Book of Mormon Geography</h1>

        <p>
            The following is the official essay titled "Book of Mormon Geography" with our annotations and commentary.
            This essay was released by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on their website in January 2019
            to explain why many early Church leaders taught that the Book of Mormon took place in America, specifically
            why the Hill Cumorah in New York was considered the same as the Book of Mormon's Hill Cumorah. However, the
            Church now distances itself from that teaching due to advances in archaeology, genetics, and history, which
            show that the Book of Mormon events could not have occurred at the Hill Cumorah. In the essay below, all
            text in <span class="essay-text">blue</span> is the unedited text from the Church’s essay, while our
            commentary is in black. You can find
            the essay on the Church's website <a
                href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics/book-of-mormon-geography?lang=eng">[here]</a>.

            This essay is one of the shorter Gospel Topics essays, part of a newer trend from the Church since
            2013-2014, releasing shorter essays than the initial larger ones. Nonetheless, it introduces members to
            several issues that have been difficult for both apologists and members to reconcile, including findings in
            archaeology, DNA, and migration patterns since Joseph Smith's time.

            We will include many quotes to demonstrate how the Church clearly taught that the Hill Cumorah in New York
            was the same as the one mentioned in the Book of Mormon. We will also discuss how Lamanites were identified
            as Native Americans, who were said to match the Book of Mormon’s descriptions of Lamanites with darker skin.
            However, the Church only began shifting away from these beliefs as advances in technology and science made
            it impossible to maintain that the Book of Mormon events took place in America.

            As President George Albert Smith once said: <em> “If a faith will not bear to be investigated; if its
                preachers
                and professors are afraid to have it examined, their foundation must be very weak.”</em> (Journal of
            Discourses,
            Volume 14, Page 216)

            Before we begin, I want to note that the Church has modified the essay since its original release in January
            2019. We are responding to the original text, but you can view the revised version on their website through
            the link above. The main difference is the removal of a quote from Anthony W. Ivins, which is crucial for
            understanding the issues with this essay. With that said, let’s begin:
        </p>

        <h2><span class="essay-text">Book of Mormon Geography</span></h2>

        <h3><span class="essay-text">Overview</span></h3>
        <p>
            <span class="essay-text">
                The Church takes no position on the specific geographic location of Book of Mormon events in the ancient
                Americas. Church members are asked not to teach theories about Book of Mormon geography in Church
                settings but to focus instead on the Book of Mormon’s teachings and testimony of Jesus Christ and His
                gospel.
            </span>
        </p>

        <p>
            This is technically true in the sense that the church takes no position on the geographic location of the
            Book of Mormon events today, but this is absolutely not the case for the church's teachings until recently.
            There are two areas that we are going to highlight as we look at this essay, and those are the location of
            the Hill Cumorah and the idea that "Indians" (Native Americans) are the descendants of Lamanites.
            <br><br>
            Before we jump too deep into these two areas, I hope anyone who has not read our annotated Gospel Topics
            essay on DNA and the Book of Mormon would do so. That annotated essay gives a ton of detailed information of
            the problem that DNA has created for the Book of Mormon's truth claims, and is vital to understanding the
            issues that will be discussed here. While our annotated DNA essay is much longer, it really does explain why
            it is impossible to separate the Book of Mormon story away from America given both the Book of Mormon itself
            along with revelations that Joseph Smith claimed were from God.
            <br><br>
            Back to the essay:
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="essay-text">
                <a class="cross-ref" href="/study/manual/gospel-topics/book-of-mormon?lang=eng">The Book of Mormon</a>
                includes a history of an ancient people who migrated from the Near East to the Americas. This history
                contains information about the places they lived, including descriptions of landforms, natural features,
                and the distances and cardinal directions between important points. The internal consistency of these
                descriptions is one of the striking features of the Book of Mormon.
            </span>
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="essay-text">
                Since the publication of the Book of Mormon in 1830, members and leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ
                of Latter-day Saints have expressed numerous opinions about the specific locations of the events
                discussed in the book. Some believe that the history depicted in the Book of Mormon—with the exception
                of the events in the Near East—occurred in North America, while others believe that it occurred in
                Central America or South America. Although Church members continue to discuss such theories today, the
                Church’s only position is that the events the Book of Mormon describes took place in the ancient
                Americas.
            </span>
        </p>

        <p>
            As mentioned above, two areas are of vital importance for understanding how the Church has taught Book of
            Mormon geography: the location of the Hill Cumorah and the identity of the Lamanites. This seems like a good
            moment to examine how the Church taught that the Hill Cumorah, where Joseph Smith claimed to have received
            the gold plates for the Book of Mormon, is the same Hill Cumorah where hundreds of thousands were killed in
            Book of Mormon battles. But before we discuss what Joseph Smith said about the Hill Cumorah, let’s look at
            what the Book of Mormon states:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            "Therefore I made this record out of the plates of Nephi, and <strong>hid up in the hill Cumorah</strong>
            all the records
            which had been entrusted to me by the hand of the Lord, save it were these few plates which I gave unto my
            son Moroni." Mormon 6:6
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This verse alone makes it clear that the records were buried in the same Hill Cumorah where the Book of
            Mormon battles took place. This is logical, given the absurdity of calling the hill from which Joseph Smith
            claimed to have retrieved the plates "Cumorah" if it were not the same hill.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the canonized Joseph Smith history, Joseph Smith also makes it clear that the records pertain to this
            continent (i.e., North America):
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            "He said there was a book deposited, written upon gold plates, giving an account of the <strong>former
                inhabitants
                of this continent</strong> , and the source from whence they sprang. He also said that the fulness of
            the everlasting
            Gospel was contained in it, as delivered by the Savior to the ancient inhabitants" (Joseph Smith History
            1:34)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Even if you don't believe that the Book of Mormon and Joseph Smith's history are taking a clear stance here,
            consider this excerpt from "Letter VII" by Oliver Cowdery to W.W. Phelps, which provides an explanation of
            Joseph Smith’s history in obtaining the plates (emphasis added):
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            "I must now give you some description of the place where, and the manner in which these records were
            deposited.
            <br><br>
            About four miles from Palmyra, you pass a large hill on the east side of the road. Why I say large, is
            because it is as large perhaps, as any in that country. To a person acquainted with this road, a description
            would be unnecessary, as it is the largest and rises the highest of any on that rout.... The soil is of the
            first quality for the country, and under a state of cultivation, which gives a prospect at once imposing,
            when one reflects on the fact,<strong> that here, between these hills, the entire power and national
                strength of
                both the Jaredites and Nephites were destroyed</strong>.
            <br><br>
            By turning to the 529th and 530th pages of the book of Mormon you will read Mormon’s account of the last
            great struggle of his people, as <strong> they were encamped round this hill Cumorah. (it is printed
                Camorah</strong>, which
            is an error) <strong> In this vally fell the remaining strength and pride of a once powerful people, the
                Nephites</strong>—once so highly favored of the Lord, but at that time in darkness, doomed to suffer
            extermination by
            the hand of their barbarous and uncivilized brethren. <strong> From the top of this hill, Mormon, with a few
                others,
                after the battle, gazed with horror upon the mangled remains of those who, the day before, were filled
                with
                anxiety, hope or doubt</strong>. A few had fled to the South, who were hunted down by the victorious
            party, and all
            who would not deny the Saviour and his religion, were put to death. Mormon himself, according to the record
            of his son Moroni, was also slain.
            <br><br>
            ...Alma, who lived before the coming of the Messiah, prophesies this. He, however, by divine appointment,
            abridged from those records, in his own style and language, a short account of the more important and
            prominent items, from the days of Lehi to his own time, <strong>after which he deposited, as he says, on the
                529th
                page, all the records in this same hill, Cumorah</strong> and after gave his small record to his son
            Moroni, who, as
            appears from the same, finished, after witnessing the extinction of his people as a nation.
            <br><br>
            ... <strong>the land was left to the possession of the red men, who were without inteligence</strong>, only
            in the affairs of
            their wars; and having no records, only preserving their history by tradition from father to son, lost the
            account of their true origin, and wandered from river to river, from hill to hill, from mountain to
            mountain, and from sea to sea, till the land was again peopled, in a measure, by a rude, wild, revengful,
            warlike and barbarous race.— <strong>Such are our indians</strong> .
            <br><br>
            This hill, by the Jaredites, was called Ramah: by it, or around it pitched the famous army of Coriantumr
            their tents. Coriantumr was the last king of the Jaredites The opposing army were to the west, and in this
            same vally, and near by, from day to day, did that mighty race spill their blood, in wrath, contending, as
            it were, brother against brother, and father, against son. <strong>In this same spot, in full view from the
                top of
                this same hill, one may gaze with astonishment upon the ground which was twice covered with the dead and
                dying of our fellow men</strong> . Here may be seen where once sunk to nought the pride and strength of
            two mighty
            nations; and here [p. 87] may be contemplated, in solitude, while nothing but the faithful record of Mormon
            and Moroni is now extant to inform us of the fact, scenes of misery and distress" <a
                href="https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/history-1834-1836/83#full-transcript">(Letter
                VII)</a>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Keep in mind that Oliver Cowdery was working closely with Joseph Smith at this time to provide a history for
            the Missouri members of the Church and would have served as his scribe in responding to these questions from
            W.W. Phelps. While some Church apologists seek to absolve Joseph Smith of responsibility for these ideas
            because they were not in his own handwriting, remember that by this point, Joseph Smith wrote almost nothing
            by his own hand—he relied almost exclusively on scribes.
            <br><br>
            However, the issue does not stop here. There are numerous quotes about the Hill Cumorah from early Church
            leaders, but I will highlight a few that I believe clearly illustrate the early Church's teachings on the
            Hill Cumorah:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            "A Dictionary of the Book of Mormon" by Elder George Reynolds and copyrighted by Joseph F Smith (1910):
            "Cumorah, Hill. One of the most noted places in ancient American history was the land in which was situated
            the hill known to the Jaredites as Ramah and to the Nephites as Cumorah [Mormon 6-8]. In its vicinity two

            There are even more quotes from early leaders as well as church manuals, but the reality is that the Book of
            Mormon taught that the Hill Cumorah is the <strong>same</strong> one that Joseph Smith claimed to retrieve
            plates from, Joseph Smith's history as recorded by Oliver Cowdery leaves no confusion as to where the Book
            of Mormon took place, and leaders within the church since that time have taught the same. If we look beyond
            just statements referencing the Hill Cumorah, here are a few that are from Joseph Smith himself that makes
            this point irrefutable:

        <p>
            The only reason the Church now distances itself from this teaching is that the evidence overwhelmingly shows
            that no such events occurred in America. There are no bodies at Hill Cumorah (despite claims that hundreds
            of thousands died there), no weapons, no linguistic evidence, and DNA has now proven that Native Americans
            did not originate from Jerusalem, but from Asia. In other words, the reason the Church "does not take a
            position" is because its original position has been disproven by advances in archaeology, linguistics, DNA
            research, and history. If any evidence existed to support Joseph Smith's statements about the history of
            Hill Cumorah, it would not only validate the Book of Mormon as a historical record, but it would be
            prominently displayed in every Church building, conference, and temple.
        </p>

        <p>
            One final note before we move on to the next part of the essay: the Church owns Hill Cumorah and has had
            ample time to study and scan the hill for ancient artifacts and remains. Nothing has been found—no stone box
            that held the "gold plates," no abundance of weaponry from these unprecedented battles, and no bodies from
            the hundreds of thousands said to have perished. A brief <a
                href="https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1382&context=jbms">article</a> in BYU
            Studies highlights that no evidence
            whatsoever has been found to suggest these events took place around Hill Cumorah, which is why the Church
            has allowed apologists to claim there is actually a second Hill Cumorah, located somewhere far, far away.

        <p>
            This paragraph highlights a second major reason we know the Book of Mormon is set in America: Joseph Smith’s
            claims (and God's via revelation) that the Native Americans are the Lamanites. This idea originated from a
            19th-century belief that Native Americans had dark skin because they were cursed. I highly encourage anyone
            unfamiliar with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTOWAgNDIDE">Dan Vogel’s video</a> on the "Mound
            Builder Myth" to watch it, as it explores this concept and
            its connection to Joseph Smith and the Book of Mormon.
            <br><br>
            The reason Joseph Smith spoke about the Book of Mormon's history while traveling to Missouri was because he
            genuinely believed the events took place in America. And why wouldn’t he? The Book of Mormon implies this by
            stating that the plates were buried in the same Hill Cumorah where the battles occurred. Furthermore, Joseph
            Smith claimed to receive revelations from God directing him to preach to the "Lamanites," who happened to be
            Native Americans with dark skin.
            <br><br>
            During Zion’s Camp in 1834, the group came across a mound with what appeared to be three stone altars.
            According to Heber C. Kimball, after showing the bones to Joseph Smith, "it was made known to Joseph that
            [the skeleton] had been an officer who fell in battle during the last destruction among the Lamanites, and
            his name was Zelph" (Heber C. Kimball's journal).
            <br><br>
            Zelph’s story is another significant indication that the Book of Mormon was believed to have taken place in
            America. According to Kimball, Joseph Smith was shown Zelph’s story "in a vision." This aligns with Joseph
            Smith’s pattern of seeing Book of Mormon stories in visions and recounting them to his family even before he
            claimed to have the gold plates. From Lucy Mack Smith’s history:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            "During our evening conversations, Joseph would occasionally give us some of the most amusing recitals that
            could be imagined: he would describe the ancient inhabitants of this continent; their dress, mode of
            travelling, and the animals upon which they rode; their cities, and their buildings, with every particular;
            he would describe their <​mode of​> warfare, as also their religious worship. This he would do with as much
                ease, seemingly, as if he had spent his whole life with them." <a
                    href="https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/lucy-mack-smith-history-1845/94#full-transcript">(Joseph
                    Smith Papers, Lucy Mack Smith's History)</a>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This is a pattern we see throughout Joseph Smith's life, where he claims to have visions both of Book of
            Mormon history as well as revelations including visitations from all sorts of people from God and Jesus to
            Elias and Elijah in the Kirtland temple (It needs to be noted that Elias and Elijah are the same person.
            Elias is the Greek translation and Elijah is Hebrew, but it would appear that Joseph Smith did not realize
            this during this claimed vision). If we take Joseph Smith at face value, then the Book of Mormon has to be
            in America because of the visions that were shown exclusively to him, but if we pull back from that because
            the evidence shows the Book of Mormon did not happen in America, then all of Joseph's visions must be
            questioned as well.
            <br><br>
            We highlight this problem in other areas, but sometimes when you apply apologetics to one area of Mormon
            history, you open up issues elsewhere. A great example of this is the "tight vs loose translation theories,"
            where defenders of the church will claim Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon with a "tight
            translation" when looking at the quotes from those around him, but that he also used a "loose translation"
            to explain problems such as using King James Bible language, anachronisms, Deutero-Isaiah, and other issues
            where the plates could not have possibly contained ideas or terms that are in the Book of Mormon.
            <br><br>
            Getting back to Zelph, John Taylor recorded this account from Joseph Smith of the event in the Times and
            Season along with the History of Joseph Smith.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            "I discovered that the person whose skeleton was before us, was a white Lamanite, a large thick set man, and
            a man of God. He was a warrior and chieftain under the great prophet Omandagus, who was known from the hill
            Cumorah, or Eastern sea, to the Rocky Mountains. His name was Zelph. The curse was taken from him, or at
            least in part." <a href="https://archive.org/details/TimesAndSeasonsVol6">(Times and Seasons, Vol 6, page
                1076)</a>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This again makes clear that Joseph Smith believed the Hill Cumorah was the same in New York as the Book of
            Mormon because he had received many visions of this history previously. It is also interesting and telling
            that the church neglected to give this context to the Zelph story in the essay, as it would explicitly
            contradict their overall claim that the church takes no position on Book of Mormon geography. Last, it also
            shows that Joseph Smith was told by God that Lamanites are the ancestors of the Native Americans (who could
            have their skin turn white again if they become righteous), which is a problem due to advancements in DNA
            studies as we have discussed above.
            <br><br>
            But to illustrate this point, I want to provide just a few quotes to make clear that Joseph Smith believed
            the Book of Mormon was in America due to the text of the book itself along with direct revelation from God:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>D&C 54:8</strong> And thus you shall take your journey into the regions westward, unto the land

            <li>
                <strong>D&C 28:14</strong> And thou shalt assist to settle all these things, according to the covenants
                of the church, <strong>before thou shalt take thy journey among the Lamanites</strong>.

            <li>
                <strong>D&C 19:27</strong> Which is my word to the Gentile, <strong>that soon it may go to the Jew, of
                    whom the Lamanites are a remnant</strong>, that they may believe the gospel, and look not for a
                Messiah to come who has already come.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>D&C 30:6</strong> ...for I have given unto him power to <strong>build up my church among the
                    Lamanites</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>D&C 28:9</strong> ...and no man knoweth where the city of Zion shall be built, but it shall be
                given hereafter. Behold, I say unto you that <strong>it shall be on the borders by the
                    Lamanites</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>D&C 32:2</strong> ...he shall go with my servants, Oliver Cowdery and Peter Whitmer, Jun.,
                <strong>into the wilderness among the Lamanites</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>D&C 3:18</strong> <strong>And this testimony shall come to the knowledge of the
                    Lamanites</strong>, and the Lemuelites, and the Ishmaelites, who dwindle in unbelief because of the
                iniquity of their fathers...
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>D&C 28:8</strong> And now, behold, I say unto you that <strong>you shall go unto the
                    Lamanites</strong> and preach my gospel unto them.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            And this is why the church can not escape the problem: Even if you ignore the Book of Mormon stating the the
            Hill Cumorah is the same one that the plates were buried at (in New York), the revelations from God make
            perfectly clear that the descendants of the Lamanites are the Native Americans in the United States.

            But because of DNA we know that the Lamanites that are described in these revelations from God have nothing
            to do with Native Americans, which is why the church no longer takes a position on who the Lamanites are or
            where the Book of Mormon took place.
            <br><br>
            In other words, the Book of Mormon tells us that the Book of Mormon took place in America, Joseph Smith's
            history and retellings tell us that the Book of Mormon took place in America, and God (via Joseph Smith)
            tells us through revelation that the Book of Mormon took place in America. If that's not enough, here are a
            few brief quotes from church leaders throughout the years confirming that the church taught and believed
            that Native Americans are the descendants of Lamanites, in America.

        </blockquote>

        <p>
            So why is the church no longer teaching that the Book of Mormon took place in America? As we've already
            covered above, there is simply no evidence to support that any of these events could have taken place in
            America. It is impossible to believe that hundreds of thousands of people could die in battles and leave not
            a single trace of weapons, bones, or buildings. Add to that the DNA problems, the linguistic problems, and
            issues with migration studies and there is simply nowhere that apologists can place the Book of Mormon in a
            historical sense without exposing their truth claims in other areas.
            <br><br>
            One last note about the church using the following statement in the essay: "In 1842, the Church newspaper
            Times and Seasons published articles under Joseph Smith’s editorship that identified the ruins of ancient
            native civilizations in Mexico and Central America as further evidence of the Book of Mormon’s historicity."
            <br><br>
            As you'll see when you look at the footnote (we included that above), those articles were not claimed to be
            written by Joseph Smith nor is there any indication that he referenced or endorsed the articles or ideas in
            any way. That the church is including this as evidence that Joseph Smith was teaching that the Book of
            Mormon might have taken place in Central America is misleading at best, which is why their own footnote has
            to admit that "it is not clear how involved Joseph Smith was in writing these editorials."
            <br><br>
            Back to the essay:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            <span class="essay-text">
                Anthony W. Ivins, a Counselor in the First Presidency, stated: “There has never been anything yet set
                forth that definitely settles that question [of Book of Mormon geography]. So the Church says we are
                just waiting until we discover the truth.” <sup>3</sup> The Church urges local leaders and members not
                to advocate
                theories of Book of Mormon geography in official Church settings.
            </span>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This statement was quietly removed from the essay, and for good reason. In this quote, Ivins was speaking
            about the city of Zarahemla and not Hill Cumorah. Take a look at this quote in its full context:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            "There is a great deal of talk about the geography of the Book of Mormon. Where was the land of Zarahemla?
            Where was the City of Zarahemla? and other geographic matters. It does not make any difference to us. There
            has never been anything yet set forth that definitely settles that question. So the Church says we are just
            waiting until we discover the truth. All kinds of theories have been advanced. I have talked with at least
            half a dozen men that have found the very place where the City of Zarahemla stood, and notwithstanding the
            fact that they profess to be Book of Mormon students, they vary a thousand miles apart in the places they
            have located. We do not offer any definite solution."
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            While this might seem like nitpicking, the problem is compounded when you look at Ivins' statement from just
            a year earlier about Hill Cumorah:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            "And the more extended discussion of this subject by Elder B. H. Roberts which was published in The Deseret
            News of March 3 definitely established the following facts: That the hill Cumorah, and the hill Ramah are
            identical. That it was around this hill that the armies of both the Jaredites and Nephites fought their
            great last battles. That it was in this hill that Mormon deposited all of the sacred records which had been
            entrusted to his care by Ammaron, except the abridgment which he had made from the plates of Nephi, which
            were delivered into the hands of his son, Moroni. We know positively that it was in this hill that Moroni
            deposited the abridgment made by his father, and his own abridgment of the record of the Jaredites, and that
            it was from this hill that Joseph Smith obtained possession of them.... All of these incidents to which I
            have referred [the battles at Hill Cumorah in the Book of Mormon], my brethren and sisters, are very closely
            associated with this particular spot in the state of New York."
            <a href="https://archive.org/stream/improvementera3108unse/improvementera3108unse_djvu.txt">(Improvement
                Era, June 1928)</a>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Clearly Ivins believed that Hill Cumorah was the same one in New York as in the Book of Mormon, and the
            quote used in the essay was clearly taken out of context to give plausibility to the idea that the church
            did not teach that the Hill Cumorah in New York was the same as in the Book of Mormon.
            <br><br>
            One other reason for the Ivins quote about where some of the Book of Mormon cities are is that in early
            1920s the first advancements were made in blood typing ( <a
                href="https://dnacenter.com/history-of-dna-testing/">Introduction to DNA Testing History</a> ). This led
            to the first real evidence that Native
            Americans are not from Israel, which of course poses a massive problem for the Book of Mormon along with
            Joseph Smith's revelations. That explains this part of the talk from the essay that was not mentioned in the
            quote above: "And so if discoveries are made which suggest differences in race origins, it can very easily
            be accounted for, and reasonably, for we do believe that other people came to this continent."
            <br><br>
            In other words, the talk outlined by the essay is seeking to establish the idea that there were other
            populations in America when Lehi's group arrived. We cover this apologetic argument in our annotated DNA and
            the Book of Mormon essay, but it simply does not hold up to both the Book of Mormon or early church
            teachings as well. Regardless, we wanted to note the context of the talk by Ivins and why the need arose to
            not place Book of Mormon events in New York as the Book of Mormon and Joseph Smith taught.
            <br><br>
            The church has since replaced this paragraph with these two paragraphs:
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="essay-text">
                Individuals may have their own opinions regarding Book of Mormon geography and other such matters about
                which the Lord has not spoken. However, the <a class="cross-ref"
                    href="/study/manual/gospel-topics/first-presidency?lang=eng">First Presidency</a> and <a
                    class="cross-ref" href="/study/manual/gospel-topics/quorum-of-the-twelve-apostles?lang=eng">Quorum
                    of
                    the Twelve Apostles</a> urge leaders and members not to advocate those personal theories in any
                setting
                or manner that would imply either prophetic or Church support for those theories. All parties should
                strive
                to avoid contention on these matters.
            </span>
            Put another way, the church was forced to remove the one quote that they thought helped their cause and
            replace it with a stronger statement for members to not discuss where the Book of Mormon took place in any
            official capacity. As we've noted with other problematic topics, this is a position that only comes out of
            necessity when the history as taught does not hold up to the evidence.
        </p>

        <p><span class="essay-text">
                Speaking of the book’s history and geography, President Russell M. Nelson taught: “Interesting as these
                matters may be, study of the Book of Mormon is most rewarding when one focuses on its <em>primary</em>
                purpose—to testify of Jesus Christ. By comparison, all other issues are incidental.”<a class="note-ref"
                    href="/study/manual/gospel-topics/book-of-mormon-geography?lang=eng#note3"
                    data-scroll-id="note3"><sup class="marker">3</sup></a>
            </span>
        </p>

        <p>
            This final paragraph follows the pattern of most of the troubling gospel topics essays: members are
            encouraged not to focus on evidence or history but to rely on prayer and spiritual confirmation. However,
            the issue is that when one closely examines spiritual confirmations, it becomes evident that they are not
            reliable for discovering truth.
            <br><br>
            The power of a spiritual witness is challenging to question because it is based on personal experiences.
            This is why the church leans heavily on it to discourage members from questioning its truth claims.
            Unfortunately, this reliance is not unique to the church; nearly every religious group uses the same
            approach. I refer you to this YouTube video, which illustrates how other churches, including a polygamous
            splinter group from the LDS church, utilize spiritual confirmations in similar ways. It’s a compelling video
            that demonstrates how spiritual witnesses occur across various religions and movements. It also highlights
            how people with entirely different worldviews and beliefs receive these spiritual confirmations, which would
            be impossible if they were all truly received from an unchanging and consistent God.
            <br><br>
            There are many areas where one can scrutinize the Book of Mormon's geographical claims. However, the essay's
            primary goal is to reassure members that the church does not take a stance on where Book of Mormon events
            occurred. As we noted earlier, this is accurate today, but only out of necessity. The church has taken a
            similar approach with other issues where scientific and historical advances have forced it to revise its
            truth claims. A few examples include:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                When DNA evidence revealed that Native Americans originated from Asia rather than Jerusalem, as the Book
                of Mormon suggests, the church changed the introduction to the Book of Mormon. Instead of stating that
                the Lamanites were the "principal ancestors" of Native Americans, it now says they are "among the
                ancestors." This is a crucial change, which we explore in-depth in our annotated gospel topics essay on
                DNA and the Book of Mormon.
            </li>
            <li>
                The church defended the authenticity of Joseph Smith’s translation of the Kinderhook Plates until
                science proved in the 1980s that they were a hoax. This creates two major problems for the church’s
                truth claims: first, Joseph Smith partially translated plates that were fabricated as a trick,
                indicating he could not differentiate between real ancient languages and fake ones. Second, the church's
                leaders defended the plates as authentic for nearly 140 years, even though science eventually exposed
                them as fraudulent. This poses a significant issue when considering that prophets, seers, and revelators
                are supposed to have the gift of discernment. We cover the timeline of this issue in our Kinderhook
                Plates summary.
            </li>
            <li>
                Perhaps the most significant issue is the Book of Abraham. Joseph Smith claimed this was a direct
                translation of Abraham's writings, “written by his hand, upon papyrus.” However, once the Egyptian
                language was deciphered, scholars determined that Joseph’s translation was entirely incorrect.
                Additionally, the papyrus was dated and found to have been produced 2,000 years after Abraham’s time.
                This discovery led the church to move away from the idea of a direct translation and instead adopt
                apologetic theories such as the “lost scroll theory” and the “catalyst theory.” We examine these
                arguments and the church’s shifting truth claims in our annotated Book of Abraham gospel topics essay.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            In the case of Book of Mormon geography, it is clear that the church once held a position. Joseph Smith
            himself described the events of the Book of Mormon as having occurred in America, and church leaders
            testified of receiving spiritual confirmations while standing on Hill Cumorah, where they envisioned the
            battles described in the book.
        </p>

        <p>
            This presents a problematic situation for the church today. The notion that the Book of Mormon events took
            place in America is no longer tenable. The church owns the Hill Cumorah property and knows that no evidence
            of battles has been found there. Consequently, the church now allows its historians and apologists to debate
            the geography of the Book of Mormon, while it refrains from taking a definitive stance, likely out of
            concern that it could be proven wrong, as Joseph Smith and other early leaders were.
        </p>

        <p>
            One final note to this essay applies to the other essays as well: if the church is truly led by God and has
            fifteen "ordained prophets, seers, and revelators," why is no one able to receive answers from God on such
            consequential questions related to the church’s history? Joseph Smith claimed to have received vivid visions
            of the Book of Mormon stories, which he shared with his family even before claiming to have received the
            plates. Yet today, the church’s current leaders seem unable to provide answers to fundamental questions such
            as the geography of the Book of Mormon, the origins of the Book of Abraham, or the identity of the
            Lamanites.
        </p>

        <p>
            We recently discussed how the church refuses to take a position on several issues. Upon examining the
            evidence and history, the reason becomes apparent: there are no satisfactory answers to the problems with
            Mormonism's truth claims. Any stance the church takes only raises more issues than it resolves.
        </p>

        <p>
            Thank you for reading this annotated essay. I hope you will continue to research this issue and explore both
            LDS and non-LDS sources to get the full picture. Personally, while this essay may not be at the top of the
            list of concerns regarding the church's truth claims, it is important to understand how advances in science,
            archaeology, and history have compelled the church to revise key claims, such as the location of Book of
            Mormon events and the identity of the Lamanites.
