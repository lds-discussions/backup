        <h1>Significant Miraculous Faith-Promoting Stories in Mormon History
        </h1>

        <p>
            This section briefly highlights some of the more well-known miraculous, faith-promoting stories told in the
            LDS Church and examines the historical records regarding their authenticity. These stories are crucial to
            review because much of the Church’s foundation rests on the belief that Joseph Smith experienced the First
            Vision as described in the 1838 account, that the priesthood restoration occurred as Joseph Smith later
            revised the narrative, and that an angel with a drawn sword commanded him to enter into polygamous
            marriages. As we have found with many important historical questions concerning Joseph Smith, the answers
            often conflict with what is still taught in the Church today. Therefore, it is essential to assess whether
            other faith-promoting stories hold up in light of what we now know about the true history.
        </p>

        <h2>1. The Transfiguration of Brigham Young</h2>
        <h3>Overview</h3>

        <p>
            After Joseph Smith's death, no clear succession plan was left to appoint the next prophet. As a result, a
            meeting was arranged where both Sidney Rigdon and Brigham Young asserted their right to lead the
            church—Rigdon as prophet, and Young as the leader of the Twelve. According to LDS history, the following
            took place:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            "Brigham Young, a man fiercely loyal to the Prophet Joseph Smith, current President of the Twelve and later
            to become known as the 'Lion of the Lord,' takes the stand. Suddenly, the people rise en masse, astonished.
            One eyewitness later recalled, 'It appeared that Joseph had returned and was speaking to the people.' As
            Brigham Young begins speaking, hundreds in the audience believe 'in every possible degree it [was] Joseph’s
            voice, and his person, in look, attitude, dress, and appearance—it [was] Joseph himself, personified.'" <a
                href="http://ldsanswers.org/evidence-transfiguration-brigham-young/">(ldsanswers.org)</a>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This is a pivotal moment in LDS history because, following Joseph's death, the church splintered into
            various factions. All living witnesses followed Emma Smith to form the Reorganized LDS Church, believing
            that polygamy was not ordained by God. This event is used to justify why Brigham Young was divinely chosen
            to lead the church, asserting that his leadership was sanctioned by God.
        </p>

        <h3>What History Tells Us</h3>

        <p>
            This story faces the same challenges as other key LDS events, such as Joseph Smith's First Vision, the
            restoration of the priesthood, and the polygamy revelation: nothing was documented at the time. This is
            particularly problematic for Brigham Young’s alleged transfiguration, given that many letters, journals, and
            even newspapers from the day of the meeting exist—yet none mention this miraculous event until 13 years
            later, when Albert Carrington brought it up in a speech to LDS members.
            <br><br>
            Richard Van Wagoner examined this evolution in an article for Dialogue, noting that journals from the days
            surrounding the meeting describe the event but omit any reference to a transfiguration. He observes that
            "the legend is now unsurpassed in Mormon lore, second only to Joseph Smith’s account of angelic
            ministrations and his ‘first vision,’" and that "when August 8, 1844, is stripped of emotional overlay,
            there is no irrefutable contemporary evidence to support the occurrence of a mystical event either in the
            morning or afternoon gatherings." (Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought, Volume 28, No. 4, Winter 1995)
            <br><br>
            Van Wagoner further argues that "the paramount dilemma with retrospective transfiguration recountings is why
            so many otherwise honorable, pious people recalled experiencing something they likely did not. A rational
            explanation is that a ‘contagious’ thought can spread through the populace, creating a ‘collective mind.’"
            This concept is important when considering Joseph Smith and the witnesses, whose accounts evolved over time,
            aligning with the "collective mind" as they aged.
            <br><br>
            LDS Answers claims that "within a year of the ‘transfiguration,’ the miracle had been referenced several
            times," though they provide no sources. This event was supposedly covered in both Nauvoo newspapers and
            church leaders' notes. The idea that such a miraculous event was missed by these records defies common
            sense. If it had been documented, it would be prominently featured in every lesson explaining why Brigham
            Young was chosen as Joseph Smith's successor.
            <br><br>
            Wilford Woodruff wrote seven pages in his journal that day, with no mention of any transfiguration, change
            in voice, or other miraculous events. Parley P. Pratt’s autobiography, completed in 1856, also makes no
            reference to anything miraculous. Likewise, writings from Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, and Willard
            Richards from that day are silent on the matter.
            <br><br>
            One diary, that of George Laub, has been used by LDS scholars to support the claim that the event was
            recorded contemporaneously. However, as Van Wagoner points out, "This small tan-colored leather diary, which
            has misled many scholars, has now been determined to be a copy made by Laub himself, with additions." The
            original diary has since been found, containing no reference to Brigham Young's transfiguration.
            <br><br>
            In an 1869 General Conference talk, Apostle Orson Hyde claimed that when Brigham Young spoke, "his words
            went through me like electricity…This is my testimony; it was not only the voice of Joseph, but there were
            the features, the gestures, and even the stature of Joseph before us in the person of Brigham." (Journal of
            Discourses 13:181)
            <br><br>
            The problem, however, is that Orson Hyde wasn’t in Nauvoo that day—he arrived five days later, as confirmed
            by Wilford Woodruff’s journal. Despite this, Hyde’s account continues to be used in church lessons, raising
            further questions about the reliability of church history when critical events cannot withstand basic
            scrutiny but are still taught repeatedly.
        </p>

        <h3>Why It Matters</h3>

        <p>
            Brigham Young’s transfiguration is central to the story of why he was chosen to lead the church after Joseph
            Smith’s death. Even LDS Answers acknowledges this: "If the Lord miraculously transfigured Brigham Young’s
            appearance, Brigham Young was divinely sanctioned as Joseph Smith’s successor. If this transfiguration never
            took place, the very foundations of our LDS faith and history are weakened."
        </p>

        <p>
            As with many other issues documented in these essays—such as priesthood authority or scripture—the
            historical record does not support the claims that form the foundation of the LDS Church. For example, the
            First Vision wasn’t shared with church members until 20 years after it allegedly occurred, the priesthood
            restoration narrative was rewritten to include John the Baptist years later, Joseph Smith never used the
            gold plates during translation, the Lamanites are not Native Americans (as DNA analysis has shown), and
            Brigham Young never transformed into Joseph Smith during the meeting to determine the next church leader.
            <br><br>
            Furthermore, as with these other topics, the church is well aware of the historical facts surrounding these
            events, yet continues to teach a false narrative. This story is even included in the recent Saints book,
            despite the careful omission of the fact that it wasn’t recorded at the time. As we’ve repeatedly stated,
            the most plausible reason for this is that the event didn’t happen as it has been told. Faith is about
            believing in things we cannot see, but it should not require us to believe in things contrary to what we can
            see.
            <br><br>
            This is a foundational story in LDS history, yet no evidence supports it. Leaders such as Orson Hyde
            fabricating their presence only cast further doubt on other miraculous stories from the church's early days.
            As Van Wagoner concludes, "Since these things are myth, and our Church has permitted them to be
            perpetuated…might not the other fundamentals to the actual story of the Church, the things in which it had
            its origin, be lies as well?"
        </p>

        <h2>2. The Miracle of the Gulls</h2>

        <h3>Overview</h3>

        <p>
            From Wikipedia: The "miracle of the gulls" is often credited by Latter-day Saints (Mormons) for saving the
            Mormon pioneers' first harvest in Utah. According to Mormon folklore, seagulls miraculously saved the 1848
            crops by eating thousands of insects that were destroying their fields. <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle_of_the_gulls">(Wikipedia - Miracle of the Gulls)</a>
            <br><br>
            After arriving in Utah, the Mormons began planting crops and initially had good luck, with the mild weather
            helping to preserve their harvest. However, swarms of insects soon arrived and began ravaging the crops.
            These insects, now known as "Mormon crickets," have wings but cannot fly; they travel in hordes, devouring
            everything in their path. Shortly after, seagulls arrived and began eating the insects, regurgitating them,
            and consuming even more.
            <br><br>
            This story has been retold by many church leaders over the years. The seagull is now the state bird of Utah,
            and a monument commemorating this event, which is believed to have saved the pioneers' crops in 1848, stands
            in the state.
        </p>

        <h3>What History Tells Us</h3>

        <p>
            Like the story of the transfiguration, the "miracle of the gulls" was not documented at the time it
            supposedly occurred. Utah archaeologist David Madsen recalls his father, historian Brigham Madsen,
            researching the origins of the story. "He started looking into it," David recalls, "and he could hardly find
            any written evidence supporting what was claimed to be this seagull miracle." While Brigham did find
            references to cricket infestations in Mormon diaries, he didn’t uncover the same level of desperation or
            despair over the crickets that the modern version of the story describes. Moreover, there was little
            evidence that seagulls played a major role in resolving the problem. Although some accounts mention seagulls
            and other birds eating the crickets, many journals from that time do not even reference seagulls at all. <a
                href="https://www.cityweekly.net/utah/a-seagull-story/Content?oid=3613991">(Salt Lake City Weekly)</a>
            <br><br>
            Orson Hyde, a key figure in spreading the story of Brigham Young's transfiguration—despite not being
            present—was also one of the first to tell the seagull miracle story. At the 1853 General Conference, Hyde
            stated, "The hand of Providence prepared agents and sent them to destroy the destroyer; a rare occurrence,
            one never before known to exist, nor since, to any extent." It should be noted that Orson Hyde was on a
            mission in Europe when this event occurred, yet he recounted the story as if he had witnessed it firsthand.
            <br><br>
            William G. Hartley, a BYU history professor, wrote about this in Chapter 8 of New Mormon History, entitled
            "Mormons, Crickets, and Gulls: A New Look at an Old Story." Hartley observed that seagulls were common in
            the area and routinely ate insects, regurgitating the hard shells they couldn’t digest. He also noted that
            the gulls only arrived after the crops had already suffered severe damage. A combination of frost, drought,
            and insects contributed to the year's crop failure. Hartley, along with Madsen, concluded that the
            miraculous nature of the event wasn’t clearly documented in journals, newspapers, or official church
            correspondence until years later.
        </p>

        <h3>Why It Matters</h3>

        <p>
            At face value, the seagull story seems insignificant, intended primarily to inspire faith. However, the
            pattern of presenting these stories as truth is concerning. Similar to the transfiguration story, the
            varying First Vision accounts, changes in the priesthood restoration narrative, and the translation of the
            Book of Mormon, among others, we encounter numerous lessons in the church that are not supported by
            historical evidence. The obvious takeaway here is that these stories likely did not happen as told, which
            raises further questions about the credibility of other stories shared by early church leaders.

        <h2>Wilford Woodruff's Vision of the Founding Fathers</h2>

        <h3>Overview</h3>

        <p>
            In September 1877, Wilford Woodruff shared a vision in which the Founding Fathers visited him at the Salt
            Lake City Tabernacle. He recounted, "I will here say, before closing, that two weeks before I left St.
            George, the spirits of the dead gathered around me, wanting to know why we did not redeem them. Said they,
            'You have had the use of the Endowment House for a number of years, and yet nothing has ever been done for
            us. We laid the foundation of the government you now enjoy, and we never apostatized from it, but we
            remained true to it and were faithful to God.' These were the signers of the Declaration of Independence,
            and they waited on me for two days and two nights. I thought it very singular that, despite so much work
            being done, nothing had been done for them. The thought never entered my heart, likely because our minds
            were focused on our more immediate friends and relatives. I straightaway went to the baptismal font and
            called upon Brother McCallister to baptize me for the signers of the Declaration of Independence, and fifty
            other eminent men, making one hundred in all, including John Wesley, Columbus, and others. I then baptized
            him for every President of the United States, except three; and when their cause is just, someone will do
            the work for them." <a

        <h3>What History Tells Us</h3>

        <p>
            This story, like many others, presents a challenge for church leaders—it does not hold up against basic
            historical facts. In his book Dimensions of Faith: A Mormon Studies Reader, Brian H. Stuy reveals that
            baptisms for the signers had already been performed by Haden Wells Church and John M. Bernhisel as recently
            as a year before Woodruff claimed these men appeared to him in the St. George Temple. Furthermore,
            <strong>many of
                the Founding Fathers had already been baptized multiple times</strong>, especially considering that 1876
            marked the
            centennial of the Declaration of Independence, a year in which the founders were on the minds of many early
            church members.
            <br><br>
            Some LDS apologists have since suggested that the founders were not referring to baptisms but to temple
            ordinances for the dead. However, there are three major issues with this interpretation. First, the quote
            clearly states, "nothing had been done for them," which is inaccurate, as baptisms had already been
            performed. Second, Woodruff explicitly says, "I straightaway went into the baptismal font and called upon
            Brother McCallister to baptize me for the signers of the Declaration of Independence," making it clear that
            he was referring to baptisms. Third, as Stuy points out in his essay, why would the Founders urge Woodruff
            to repeat ordinances that had already been completed? They could not have been referring to endowments, as
            these were not performed for the dead in the Endowment House. Additionally, Woodruff recounted this story
            three times, so it cannot be dismissed as a misrecording or a rushed decision to baptize them after the
            vision.
        </p>

        <h3>Why It Matters</h3>

        <p>
            Woodruff's story further underscores the unreliability of miraculous accounts from early church leaders.
            While some 'neo-apologists' may argue that the truth is secondary to the lesson, this is another case where
            early history fails to align with the facts now available to us. Why did Woodruff have a vision where the
            Founding Fathers requested baptisms that had already been performed? There are no satisfactory answers to
            this, and it continues a pattern of miraculous events—such as the First Vision, the transfiguration of
            Brigham Young, and the priesthood restoration—that do not correspond with what we know from historical
            documents.

        <h2>4. Lorenzo Snow's Visit From Jesus</h2>

        <h3>Overview</h3>

        <p>
            Lorenzo Snow shared with his granddaughter that, following the death of Wilford Woodruff, he received a
            personal revelation from Jesus in the temple. According to Friend Magazine by the LDS Church:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            President Snow
            abruptly stopped and said, “Wait a moment, Allie. I want to tell you something.” Allie listened attentively
            as her grandfather recounted an unforgettable experience that took place in the temple: “It was right here
            that the Lord Jesus Christ appeared to me after President Woodruff's death. He instructed me to immediately
            reorganize the First Presidency of the Church without delay, unlike previous transitions, and that I was to
            succeed President Woodruff as President of the Church.”

            President Snow extended his left hand and said, “He stood right here, about three feet above the floor. It
            appeared as if He was standing on a plate of solid gold.”

            Speaking in reverent tones, President Snow told Allie that the Savior’s appearance was so glorious and
            radiant that he could barely look at Him.

            Placing his right hand on Allie’s head, President Snow said, “Now, granddaughter, I want you to remember
            this testimony. I am telling you with my own lips that I saw the Savior here in the temple and spoke with
            Him face to face.” <a
                href="https://www.lds.org/friend/1993/08/lorenzo-snow-and-the-sacred-vision?lang=eng">(Friend Magazine,
                August 1993)</a>
        </blockquote>

        <h3>What History Tells Us</h3>

        <p>
            It is impossible to confirm whether this vision truly occurred, but what is known is that Lorenzo Snow did
            not speak of this event until he shared it with his granddaughter Allie. This miraculous experience was not
            mentioned in any church publication for thirty-five years, until it was reported in the Improvement Era in
            September 1933. Surprisingly, this story of Lorenzo Snow's meeting with Jesus was not featured on the cover,
            nor was it listed in the table of contents.
            <br><br>
            Similar to the First Vision, one of the most significant moments in human history went untold for decades.
            This is especially astonishing considering Lorenzo Snow served as an apostle for fifty-two years, during
            which he gave numerous talks to church members who would have been eager to know about his personal
            encounter with Jesus in the temple.
            <br><br>
            Moreover, we now rely on the memory of his granddaughter, which is a second-hand account recorded in a
            journal. This makes it difficult to determine the accuracy of what was written, let alone understand why
            Lorenzo Snow did not share this personal experience with others during his lifetime. He never even
            documented the event himself. It challenges logic to believe that an event of such magnitude would go
            entirely unrecorded by Snow while he was alive.
        </p>

        <h3>Why It Matters</h3>

        <p>
            One of the central tenets of Mormonism is the concept of a living prophet, and this story is often used to
            demonstrate that prophets continue to receive revelation from Jesus. However, the fact that Lorenzo Snow
            never publicly shared this story during his lifetime, nor wrote about it in his journals, raises questions.
            How could he live his entire life without telling anyone other than his granddaughter about this miraculous
            event? Similarly, why did Joseph Smith wait decades before sharing the First Vision with church members? Why
            did it take over a decade for the story of Brigham Young’s transfiguration to emerge and promote the idea
            that he was a prophet of God?
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <p>
            These narratives are constructed to foster faith within the LDS Church, but the critical issue is that they
            fail to align with historical facts. As thoroughly documented in the annotated essays, significant concerns
            arise surrounding the restoration of the priesthood, the issues related to Deutero-Isaiah, anachronisms, and
            the presence of King James Bible errors within the Book of Mormon. These are not isolated discrepancies but
            rather part of a broader pattern of inconsistencies.
            <br><br>
            When we analyze these issues collectively, they reveal a troubling trend. The sheer number of documented
            contradictions and historical inaccuracies cannot simply be dismissed or explained away. The fundamental
            question that emerges after examining all of these points is: How many times can stories, scriptures, or
            events be demonstrably disproven before we recognize the undeniable pattern? At what point does it become
            evident that the Church's claims do not hold up to scrutiny?"
