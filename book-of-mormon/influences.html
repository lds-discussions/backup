            Book of Mormon: Surrounding Influences
        </h2>

        <p>
            In our previous sections on the Book of Mormon, we’ve looked at how the Book of Mormon was produced and the
            many issues that biblical scholarship presents for its claims of being an ancient, historical record.
            <br><br>
            Our last section on DNA was lengthy, but it helped explain why the belief in Joseph Smith's time—that Native
            Americans were originally from Israel—is simply not true. In this section, we will explore the ideas and
            beliefs surrounding Joseph Smith that shaped the narrative of the Book of Mormon, and how those influences
            situate the Book of Mormon as a 19th-century text.
            <br><br>
            I believe this section diverges from other critical overviews because I do not think Joseph Smith
            plagiarized or copied from other books of his time. Rather, I argue that those books, like the Book of
            Mormon, emerged from the same worldview that Joseph Smith was a part of.
            <br><br>
            That’s a very important element that I believe is often overlooked when examining the issues with the Book
            of Mormon – treasure digging influenced every aspect of its production, and this was because that was the
            worldview in which Joseph Smith was embedded.
        </p>

        <h3>The King James Bible</h3>

        <p>
            We’ve already discussed how the Bible, and more specifically the King James translation, influenced the Book
            of Mormon, so there’s no need to go into detail here. If you haven’t read our sections on biblical
            scholarship, I highly recommend going back and reviewing them.
            <br><br>
            Those sections demonstrate that the Book of Mormon couldn’t have been written before 1611 (and likely not
            before 1769, as that was the version available in Joseph Smith’s time). Additionally, Joseph Smith made
            assumptions about the literalness of biblical stories that we now know are simply not true. However, since
            Joseph Smith incorporated these stories as literal events into the Book of Mormon, we can demonstrate that
            the Book of Mormon is not an authentic historical record.
        </p>

        <h3>Mound Builder Myth</h3>

        <p>
            The most significant influence on the Book of Mormon is the Moundbuilders myth, which was largely shaped by
            the biblical beliefs of Joseph Smith’s time.
            <br><br>
            The Moundbuilders myth emerged when European settlers arrived in the Americas and encountered various
            'mounds' that had been constructed. These settlers, viewing Native Americans as a wild and savage race,
            couldn’t imagine that they could have built such mounds and civilizations. Instead, they attributed the
            structures to a lost, superior race of white people, like themselves.
            <br><br>
            Although the mounds contained the remains of Native Americans, the white European settlers fabricated a
            myth, claiming these were the remains of a lost civilization that had been exterminated by the dark, savage
            Indians. If this sounds familiar, it’s because the Moundbuilders myth closely mirrors the narrative of the
            Book of Mormon.
            <br><br>
            Here’s a poem by William Cullen Bryant called 'The Prairies.' I’ll pull some sections from it below, but you
            can read the full poem <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/55341/the-prairies">here</a>.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “Let the mighty mounds<br>
            That overlook the rivers, or that rise<br>
            In the dim forest crowded with old oaks,<br>
            Answer. A race, that long has passed away,<br>
            Built them;—a disciplined and populous race…<br>
            <br><br>
            In a forgotten language, and old tunes,<br>
            From instruments of unremembered form,<br>
            Gave the soft winds a voice. The red man came—<br>
            The roaming hunter tribes, warlike and fierce,<br>
            And the mound-builders vanished from the earth….<br>
            <br><br>
            All is gone;<br>
            All—save the piles of earth that hold their bones,<br>
            The platforms where they worshipped unknown gods,<br>
            The barriers which they builded from the soil<br>
            To keep the foe at bay—till o’er the walls<br>
            The wild beleaguerers broke, and, one by one,<br>
            The strongholds of the plain were forced, and heaped<br>
            With corpses. The brown vultures of the wood<br>
            Flocked to those vast uncovered sepulchres,<br>
            And sat unscared and silent at their feast.<br>
            Haply some solitary fugitive,<br>
            Lurking in marsh and forest, till the sense<br>
            Of desolation and of fear became<br>
            Bitterer than death, yielded himself to die.<br>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This poem offers an overview of what white settlers believed about the Moundbuilders—that they were a
            superior race, killed off by the dark-skinned Indians. The poem describes how this happened through wars,
            with a single survivor who wandered the Earth until he finally surrendered to death. This narrative closely
            mirrors the story found in the Book of Mormon.
            <br><br>
            Many of these mounds have since been destroyed by settlers who took over the land, but some still remain,
            and we have photographs of those.

            mounds that were discovered</figcaption>

        <p>
            Part of the belief in the Moundbuilders myth was that there must have been an ancient white race that lived
            in the Americas and was destroyed by the Indians. This idea allowed settlers to justify their claim that the
            lands were rightfully theirs.
            <br><br>
            William Henry Harrison, who is famously known for serving as president for just 30 days, wrote the
            following:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            "If a man visited the Ohio River valley prior to white settlement, “his eye might have rested on some
            stupendous mound, or lengthened line of ramparts… which proved that the country had once been possessed by a
            numerous and laborious people. But he would’ve seen, also, indubitable evidences that centuries had passed
            away since these remains had been occupied by those for whose use they had been reared… He would not fail to
            arrive at the conclusion that their departure… must have been a matter of necessity. For no people at any
            state of civilization, would have willingly abandoned such a country…
            <br><br>
            We learn first, from the extensive country covered by their remains, that they were a numerous people.
            Secondly, that they were congregated in considerable cities… confirm the fact that they had a national
            religion; in the celebration of which, all that was pompous, gorgeous, and imposing, that a semi-barbarous
            nation could devise was brought into occasional display. That there were a numerous priesthood, and altars
            often smoking with hecatombs of victims… This much do these ancient remains furnish us, as to the condition
            and character of the people who erected them…
            <br><br>
            We refer again to the works they have left us, to gain what knowledge we can of the cause and manner of
            their leaving the Ohio valley. For the reasons formerly stated, I assume the fact that they were compelled
            to fly from a more numerous or a more gallant people. No doubt the contest was long and bloody, and that the
            country, so long their residence, was not abandoned to their rivals until their numbers were too much
            reduced to continue the contest. Taking into consideration all the circumstances, ... I have come to the
            conclusion that these people were assailed both from their northern and their southern frontier; made to
            recede from both directions, and that their last effort at resistance was made on the banks of the Ohio.”
            (<a href="https://archive.org/stream/moundbuildersrec00shet/moundbuildersrec00shet_djvu.txt">Shetrone, H. C.
                <em>The Mound-Builders: A reconstruction of the life of a prehistoric American race, through exploration
                    and interpretation of their earth mounds, their burials, and their cultural remains.</em></a>)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This is a long quote, but once again it demonstrates that, in Joseph Smith’s time, the prevailing view was
            that these mounds were evidence of an ancient race that had been exterminated by dark-skinned Indians. I
            know I keep repeating this point, but it is crucial to understanding not only how the Book of Mormon was
            created, but also why many people around Joseph Smith accepted the stories within it.
            <br><br>
            Moreover, as Native Americans began losing their lands and populations due to war, disease, and famine, this
            myth allowed settlers to justify the belief that Native Americans could not possibly have been as advanced
            or evolved as a civilization. This further reinforced the Moundbuilder myth in their worldview.
            <br><br>
            As a result, the myth grew, and settlers began telling stories of an ancient race that had attempted to fend
            off these 'savage' intruders using fortified mounds, only to be ultimately exterminated by them.
        </p>

        </figure>
        <figcaption>Depiction of a battle on a mound</figcaption>

        <p>
            Once again, this explains why the text of the Book of Mormon was accepted by so many people in the 19th
            century—it aligned with the belief that Native Americans originated from an ancient white race that was
            overtaken by the 'red Indians.'
            <br><br>
            The problem, of course, is that this was simply a myth created by settlers to explain the existence of
            Native Americans and to justify removing them from their lands, as well as slaughtering and decimating their
            populations.
            <br><br>
            As we discussed in the previous section on <em>DNA and the Book of Mormon</em>, the Americas were populated
            by people
            migrating from Asia as much as 25,000 years ago. There is no evidence that they originated from a white
            race.
            <br><br>
            This is another example showing that the Book of Mormon is a product of the 19th century, as the
            Moundbuilder myth had been largely debunked by the late 1800s. As Mormon scholar John Hamer pointed out,
            even in 1963, a movie called Kings of the Sun was still based on this idea (<a
                href="https://www.mormonstories.org/faith-crisis-stories/book-of-mormon-cultural-context-john-hamer/">Mormon
                Stories, John Hamer,<em> The
                    Book of Mormon's 19th Century Context</em></a>).
            <br><br>
            In the movie, the character Balam, prince of a more civilized (and whiter) people who arrive in North
            America by boat, begins building a city with great earthworks and immediately encounters trouble with the
            more savage (and redder) natives led by Chief Black Eagle.
            <br><br>
            I am spending a lot of time discussing the Moundbuilder myth because it helps us understand how people
            thought in Joseph Smith’s time. This will be important when we examine The View of the Hebrews below, as
            many critics claim that Joseph Smith stole ideas from The View of the Hebrews. In reality, both books were
            drawing on ideas that were widely discussed in the 1820s.
            <br><br>
            Furthermore, we now have the ability to read Mayan script, and it contains no references to anything related
            to the Book of Mormon or a white race that was overtaken through wars. The Moundbuilder myth represents
            white European settlers projecting their beliefs onto Native Americans as a way to dehumanize them—just as
            the Book of Mormon strips Native Americans and Polynesians of their identities by presenting a story that is
            neither historical nor true.
            <br><br>
            Aside from the King James Bible, the Moundbuilder myth had the most direct influence on the Book of Mormon,
            as the myth’s worldview underpins the entire premise of the Book of Mormon: explaining how Native Americans
            came to populate the Americas, with settlers believing that a superior civilization and race must have been
            'white and delightsome.'
            <br><br>
            As mentioned earlier, one goal of the Moundbuilder myth was to dehumanize Native Americans as a way to
            justify taking over their land. If settlers could create a myth that Native Americans had already
            exterminated a white, civilized race, it became easier to convince others that they had the right to take
            the land. The myth also suggested that if the settlers didn’t reclaim the land, Native Americans would do to
            them what they supposedly did to the Moundbuilders. From archaeologist Bradley Lepper:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “Prior to the Revolutionary War, the fact that the mounds had been built by American Indians was “so
            well-established that it required neither explanation nor defense.” By the time Andrew Jackson became
            president in 1829, however, that idea had become an inconvenient truth.
            <br><br>
            In his efforts to remove American Indian tribes from their lands in the Eastern United States, Jackson
            claimed that the mounds had been built by an “unknown people” who were exterminated by the “existing savage
            tribes.” Therefore, the United States government was perfectly justified in removing those tribes from the
            lands they had stolen from the supposedly more civilized lost race of Mound Builders.” (<a
                href="https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/local/2020/04/26/archaeology-saga-giant-mound-builders/1286127007/">Colavito,

                    race’</em></a>.)
        </blockquote>

        <p>While the Moundbuilder myth is indeed just that—a myth—it was still incredibly influential during Joseph
            Smith’s lifetime, and the Book of Mormon is a product of that belief. The Moundbuilder myth is also a great
            example of an etiological myth, as we discussed in our biblical scholarship sections.
        </p>

        <h3>View of the Hebrews</h3>

        <p>
            Many critics cite a book called <em>View of the Hebrews</em> as a source Joseph Smith may have drawn from
            when composing the <em>Book of Mormon</em>. While there are many similarities between the two books, there
            are also significant differences. <em>View of the Hebrews</em> was even cited by the church-run newspaper
            <em>Times and Seasons</em> as evidence supporting the <em>Book of Mormon</em>.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “If such may have been the fact, that a part of the Ten Tribes came over to America, in the way we have
            supposed, leaving the cold regions of Assareth behind them in quest of a milder climate, it would be natural
            to look for tokens of the presence of Jews of some sort, along countries adjacent to the Atlantic. In order
            to this, we shall here make an extract from an able work: written exclusively on the subject of the Ten
            Tribes having come from Asia by the way of Bherings Strait, by the Rev. Ethan Smith, Pultney, Vt., who
            relates as follows:…
            <br><br>
            That in 1815, he was leveling some ground under and near an old wood shed, standing on a place of his,
            situated on Indian Hill.
            <br><br>
            He ploughed [plowed] and conveyed away old chips and earth to some depth. After the work was done, walking
            over the place, he discovered, near where the earth had been dug the deepest, a black strap as it appeared,
            about six inches in length, and one and a half in breadth, and about the thickness of a leather trace to a
            harness.
            <br><br>
            He perceived it had at each end a loop of some hard substance, probably for the purpose of carrying it… They
            were of a dark yellow hue, and contained some kind of writing. The neighbors coming in to see the strange
            discovery, tore one of the pieces to atoms, in the true Hun and Vandal style. The other three pieces Mr.
            Merrick saved, and sent them to Cambridge,-where they where examined, and discovered to have been written
            with a pen in Hebrew, plain and legible.
            <br><br>
            The writing on the three remaining pieces of parchment, was quotation from the Old Testament. See Deut. vi.
            chap. from the 4th to the 9th verse, inclusive-also, xi. chap. 13-21, and Exodus, chap. 13-13-11,-16
            inclusive, to which the reader can refer, if he has the curiosity to read this most interesting discovery…
            <br><br>
            Dr. West of Stockbridge, relates that an old Indian informed him, that his fathers in this country had not
            long since, been in the possession of a book, which they had for a long time, carried with them, but having
            lost the knowledge of reading it, they buried it with an Indian chief...<em>View of the Hebrews, Pg.
                223.</em>
            <br><br>
            It had been handed down from family to family, or from chief to chief as a most precious relic, if not as an
            amulet, charm, or talisman, for it is not to be supposed, that a distinct knowledge of what was contained in
            the strap could have long continued among them, in their wandering condition, amid woods and forests.
            <br><br>
            It is said by Calmet, that the above texts are the very passages of Scripture, which the Jews used to write
            on the leaves of their phylacteries. These phylacteries were little rolls of parchment whereon were written
            certain words of the law. These they wore upon their forehead, and upon the wrist of the left
            arm."...Smith's
            view of the Hebrews. Pg. 220.” (<a

        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This definitely sounds very similar to the Book of Mormon coming forth, and the connection between Oliver
            Cowdery, Joseph’s main scribe for the Book of Mormon as we have it today, and the author of View of the
            Hebrew’s, Ethan Smith is noteworthy.
            <br><br>
            Ethan Smith was the pastor of a church in Poultney, VT that Oliver Cowdery attended through the time when
            View of the Hebrews was published. Cowdery then met Joseph Smith in 1829, and as Joseph Smith writes in his
            history:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “Two days after the arrival of Mr. Cowdery (being the 7th of April) I commenced to translate the Book of
            Mormon, and he began to write for me.” (Pearl of Great Price 1:67)
