        <h1>Annotated Official LDS Essay on the Book of Mormon and DNA Studies</h1>

        <p>
            The following essay is an official release from the LDS Church titled "Book of Mormon and DNA Studies." It
            was issued by the Church to explain how recent DNA evidence, which concludes that Native Americans are not
            descended from the people of the Book of Mormon, does not undermine the book's credibility. It also
            addresses why the Church's credibility remains intact despite having previously held that Native Americans
            were the direct descendants of the Book of Mormon peoples. The original essay text is presented in <span
                class="essay-text">blue</span>,
            while our annotations appear in black. You can find the official version of the essay on the LDS website

            The annotated essay below has been adapted from a continually updated source. To access the original
            material, <a

            The Book of Mormon recounts the arrival of the Jaredites and Nephites on the shores of a new Promised Land
            that God had preserved for them and their descendants. Because of this key narrative, American Indians were
            long regarded as remnants of these people, and Church leaders historically referred to them as Lamanites.
            This was before the advent of archaeology, anthropology, genetics, linguistics, and biology, which have
            since revealed an ancient Americas that bears little resemblance to the 19th-century beliefs reflected in
            the Book of Mormon.
            <br><br>
            When the Book of Mormon was first published, the origins of Native American peoples were still a topic of
            debate, sparking much intellectual and casual conversation. At that time, most Americans—both scholars and
            laypeople—accepted a racially biased theory that the mounds and pyramids of the New World were built by a
            superior race of white people, later annihilated by the darker-skinned "savages" encountered by Columbus.
            These ideas, though not introduced by the Book of Mormon, were common <strong>misconceptions</strong> in
            19th-century America
            when the book emerged. In retrospect, we can recognize these views as blatantly racist, but they were
            largely accepted in the cultural milieu of that era. Such attitudes also conveniently justified the forced
            removal of Native Americans from their lands by white colonists, who felt they were reclaiming what had
            originally belonged to an ill-treated white race. Fortunately, the 20th and 21st centuries have given us a
            much clearer picture of pre-Columbian America.
            <br><br>
            If you’re reading this essay, you likely have some awareness of the controversy it addresses, but in case
            you don’t, here’s a brief summary: The Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and a succession of
            modern prophets have all affirmed that today’s Native Americans are the Lamanites of the Book of Mormon.
            However, modern molecular biology unequivocally shows that Native Americans descended from Asians who
            migrated from Siberia <strong>long before</strong> the events of the Book of Mormon. This leaves the LDS
            Church in a
            difficult position: should they continue to teach the narrative as written, or embrace the revised
            interpretations emerging from modern apologists attempting to reconcile the book’s claims with the
            scientific evidence?
            <br><br>
            Balancing the Book of Mormon narrative with the mounting scientific evidence is becoming increasingly
            challenging for the LDS Church and a full-time occupation for its apologists. Church leaders no longer
            address these questions directly, instead delegating the task to scholars and apologists who attempt to cast
            doubt on the DNA studies that have posed such challenges for the Book of Mormon. This essay represents one
            of those efforts, and as you’ll see, it is presented in an 'anonymous' format. While the Church has
            vigorously defended other issues, such as the accounts of the First Vision or the King James Bible errors
            found in the Book of Mormon, this is one area where apologists must sidestep science entirely, as current
            DNA evidence fundamentally undermines the historical claims of the Book of Mormon.
            <br><br>
            The LDS Church stands apart from many other religious systems in its emphasis on literalism. It presents
            testable claims about real-world places and events, interpreting even the most dramatic Biblical stories,
            like the Great Flood and the Tower of Babel, in the most literal terms. While this can be an exciting
            prospect, it also sets up the Church for disappointment when these claims fail under scrutiny. LDS
            apologists often find themselves redefining scripture and selectively interpreting scientific evidence in
            order to maintain the credibility of these claims. This essay is a prime example of that approach. But does
            the Church officially endorse these apologetic tactics? The essay is hosted on the Church’s official
            website, and according to Church historian Steven E. Snow, these <a
                href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics-essays/essays?lang=eng#media=">Gospel
                Topic essays</a> "have been approved by
            the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles" . Yet none of
            the Church's leadership is willing to attach their name to the essay. If the authors had genuine faith in
            their arguments, why wouldn't they take ownership and sign their names alongside an official endorsement
            from the First Presidency?
            <br><br>
            Before you proceed with reading, ask yourself this question: if the Church possessed even a single piece of
            compelling evidence in favor of the Book of Mormon, wouldn’t every seminary manual be centered around it?
            Wouldn’t Ensign articles highlight it, and wouldn’t it be featured prominently in LDS visitor centers? The
            problem is that the Book of Mormon makes specific, testable claims about the world of the Jaredites and
            Nephites. When those claims are measured against existing evidence and found to be inaccurate, the
            apologists attempt to adjust the expectations of what the book really meant. Many Church leaders have
            sidestepped these issues by emphasizing the Book of Mormon's spiritual significance rather than its
            historical accuracy. But if the Book of Mormon can be discredited through DNA evidence, issues with the Book
            of Abraham, King James errors, and so forth, why should the LDS Church continue to claim the allegiance of
            its members when other faiths offer the same spiritual guidance without reliance on disproven scripture?
            <br><br>
            One final note before we delve into the essay: the authors provide several examples meant to suggest that
            the issue is so complex we should give up trying to find clarity. However, this is a calculated
            misdirection. Even their own examples often contradict their conclusions, as we will point out below. To
            help you follow along, we will mark these instances with a "!" symbol. This is the longest of our annotated
            essays, and for good reason. The Church is meticulous in seeking out wiggle room, so it's crucial to
            highlight where and how they are being misleading. Although these topics are scientific in nature and
            involve extensive research, we will strive to keep things as concise as possible while still providing the
            necessary depth to give you a comprehensive understanding.
            <br><br>
            As President George Albert Smith once said, “If a faith will not bear to be investigated; if its preachers
            and professors are afraid to have it examined, their foundation must be very weak” (Journal of Discourses,
            Volume 14, Page 216).

                    of Mormon</a> is more spiritual than
                historical,</span>
            (This is a big admission right off the bat, as church leaders have long maintained the Book of Mormon is a
            literal, historical document. Just two paragraphs into the essay, they are already conceding that the
            historical aspects of the book are not as clear)

            <span class="essay-text">
                some people have wondered whether the migrations it describes are compatible with scientific
                studies of ancient America. The discussion has centered on the field of population genetics and
                developments in DNA science. Some have contended that the migrations mentioned in the Book of Mormon did
                not occur because the majority of DNA identified to date in modern native peoples most closely resembles
                that of eastern Asian populations.<a
                    href="/study/manual/gospel-topics-essays/book-of-mormon-and-dna-studies?lang=eng#note2"><sup>2</sup></a>
            </span>
            (This is an even bigger admission of this essay. The church is conceding that Native Americans did not
            originate in the Middle East, and as such <strong>they are not Lamanites</strong>. They came from Asia. This
            is also the exact opposite of what church leaders have said about an Asian origin for Native Americans.
            Spencer W. Kimball said, “They are NOT orientals. They are from the Near East… it is not impossible that
            there could have seeped across the Bering Strait a little oriental blood as claimed by some people, but
            basically these Lamanites, including the Indian ARE the descendants of Lehi, who left Jerusalem 600 years
            BC.” (BYU devotional, The Lamanite: Their Burden, Our Burden, February 6, 1967). This new evidence puts the
            authenticity of the Book of Mormon in question as the entire origin of the characters in it is now
            incorrect. The Book of Mormon claims that a ship of Israelites arrived in the Americas to find an empty
            land, then multiplied to fill that land, broke into factions that grew into vast nations and eventually
            committed genocide (twice). Not once does it present a scene where any of its protagonists stumble upon vast
            numbers of Siberian immigrants already occupying the land, as this essay will now try to shift to in order
            to make the DNA problems work. Making room for this entirely separate and vastly larger population is a
            recent and dramatic reinvention of the Book of Mormon narrative that was not proposed until the Native
            Americans were scientifically demonstrated, through DNA sequencing and population genetics, to not be the
            Lamanites that the scriptures and prophets claimed they were. In making this admission the church has really
            opened many bigger questions that will now have to be patched. It not only requires a complete
            reinterpretation of the Book of Mormon that is contrary to what we were all taught, but it is also
            devastating to a literal belief in the Biblical timeline, the flood of Noah, and the Eden story, since the
            original inhabitants of the Americas arrived long before any of those.)
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="essay-text">
                Basic principles of population genetics suggest the need for a more careful approach to the data. The
                conclusions of genetics, like those of any science, are tentative, and much work remains to be done to
                fully
                understand the origins of the native populations of the Americas. Nothing is known about the DNA of Book
                of
                Mormon peoples, and even if their genetic profile were known, there are sound scientific reasons that it
                might remain undetected.
            </span>
            (It is inconceivable that the essay can make this claim. The Book of Mormon tells us exactly where the three
            founding groups came from, and in the case of the Lehites and Mulekites, we have a very precise date and a
            specific city or origin.)


            <span class="essay-text">
                For these same reasons, arguments that some defenders of the Book of Mormon make based on DNA studies
                are
                also speculative. In short, DNA studies cannot be used decisively to either affirm or reject the
                historical

            It is fascinating that they use the word “critics” here. They are not talking about critics of the Book of
            Mormon, they are talking about people who may not buy into the claims of this essay; they are talking about
            the vast majority of members and leaders of the church. You may be surprised to find yourself among those
            who this essay disparages as critics. And how do people get such critical ideas? Because they believe what
            the Book of Mormon actually says, and what Joseph Smith and every prophet since him has said. Based on the
            Book of Mormon, Nephi himself would probably be as surprised as anyone by this talk of the Promised Land
            being already overrun by other people when he arrived. God also seems to be unaware that he was sending his
            chosen people to a place that was already populated by previous settlers. He told Nephi, <strong>“it is
                wisdom that
                this land should be kept as yet from the knowledge of other nations</strong>; for behold, many nations
            would overrun
            the land, that there would be no place for an inheritance...and they shall be kept from all other nations,
            that they may possess this land unto themselves” (2 Nephi 1:8,9). He told the Jaredites that he would send
            them to “<strong>that quarter where there never had man been,</strong>” to a land of promise “reserved for a
            righteous
            people.” (Ether 2:5-7) In Helaman we read: “And it came to pass that they did multiply and spread, and did
            go forth from the land southward to the land northward, and did spread insomuch that they began to cover the
            face of the whole earth, from the sea south to the sea north, from the sea west to the sea east” (Helaman
            3:8) Does this sound to you like they were merely filling small gaps among the occupants of a land that was
            already densely populated? No, they were explicitly told by God that the land was not already overrun by
            “others," and there was never any discussion otherwise until these DNA studies completely discredited the
            premise of the Book of Mormon.

            <strong>Ivins</strong> was a lawyer who gives no evidence of his assertion, although he did have enough
            experience with Indian affairs that he was probably starting to realize that the Book of Mormon has some
            serious problems. This was after archaeologist Ciril Thomas had proven that it really was Native Americans
            who built the eastern mound complexes. Apparently, the best evidence this essay can provide is the
            suggestion that the Book of Mormon “hints” about the fact that the land was already teeming with people when
            the Book of Mormon settlers arrived. The “hints” mostly consist of things like bad math that allows the
            Lehite populations to grow too fast, and the appearance of both the words Lamanite and Lamanitish, which
            apologists try to capitalize on being evidence for another society altogether. In other words, very weak
            evidence that was never used until it become expedient to do so.
        </p>

        <p>
            It's almost impossible to imagine that the Lehites would fail to mention that they landed in a heavily
            populated land, densely settled by existing chiefdoms and empires. By the time of the Nephite/Lamanite final
            war, the Maya civilization had completely occupied the entire area that modern LDS apologists claim to be
            Book of Mormon lands and, having filled the land (recent estimates put the Maya at around <strong>10-15
                million</strong>), they continued to intensify their agriculture to feed the dense population, which
            reached its peak centuries after the final Book of Mormon war with its supposed hundreds of thousands of
            combatants. Somehow the Maya were completely unaware of this great Nephite/Lamanite epic that was playing
            out right alongside them. The Maya were also unaware that the land had been destroyed by earthquakes, the
            cities dumped into the sea and covered up by falling mountains, and that Jesus had paid them a visit after
            three days of darkness. It is important to note that the Mayans had a written language which was deciphered
            long after the Book of Mormon was published, so we now have actual details of lives and events of people who
            occupied the land during the time of the Book of Mormon narrative, and they fail to mention any of these
            things. <em>Occam's Razor</em> tells you that the most obvious reason for this is that the Book of Mormon
            people did not exist as the Book of Mormon (and the prophets from Joseph Smith until now) tells us, and the
            DNA is further proof of this.

            If the land was already massively populated by other people during Book of Mormon times, why would Nephite
            explorers have made such a big deal of finding the remains of the Jaredite nation, or the isolated city of
            Zarahemla with its Mulekite inhabitants? It certainly sounds like the Nephites were under the impression
            that the only people in the land were the ones that the Book of Mormon claims arrived, like themselves, from
            the Old World. That impression is made quite clear by the verses we outlined above, which make it quite
            clear that the lands were being preserved solely for them and no one else.

            But let’s consider the things Nephi said he did find in his new home. 1 Nephi 18:25 says “And it came to
            pass
            that we did find upon the land of promise, as we journeyed in the wilderness, that there were beasts in the
            forests of every kind, both the cow and the ox, and the ass and the horse, and the goat and the wild goat,
            and all manner of wild animals, which were for the use of men.” We have lots of anachronisms throughout the
            Book of Mormon when it comes to animals, plants, metals, etc... but <strong>NO</strong> mention of people.
            Could Nephi have been such a detailed observer of the animals he found in his new home while totally failing
            to notice, or think it worth mentioning, that there were swarms of people with their cities, cultures,
            militaries, and agriculture? For some perspective on this let’s consider the Bible. The Children of Israel
            entered the Promised Land to find it already populated in exactly the way that this essay claims the
            Americas were already populated when the Lehites arrived. Imagine how different the Bible would be if its
            authors had failed to notice the Babylonians, Assyrians, Hittites, Girgashites, Amorites, Canaanites,
            Moabites, Edomites, Philistines, Perizzites, Hivites, Jebusites, Amalekites, Persians, Romans, Egyptians...
        </p>

        <p>
            It needs to be mentioned that none of the animals mentioned in the Book of Mormon existed in the
            pre-Columbian Americas either; all of the taxa mentioned were Old World domesticates that did not appear on
            American soil until the European conquerors brought them more than a millennium after Book of Mormon times.
            Nephi also completely fails to mention any of the animals that he would have actually encountered in the
            Americas. In addition, the Book of Mormon tells us that the Nephites had wheat, barley, and other Old World
            crops, things that never existed in ancient America. There is overwhelming evidence that the current New
            World flora can be traced back uninterrupted to Pleistocene times—they left their pollen on the floors of
            lakes and ponds—while there are absolutely no traces of the animals and crops mentioned in the Book of
            Mormon. If these Nephite plants and animals existed, they somehow managed to do so without leaving any
            evidence of their existence: no descendants, no DNA, no bones, no pollen, seeds, starches, or phytoliths,
            etc., while the actual native American flora and fauna did leave all of those things. All of these species
            mentioned in the Book of Mormon would have had to vanish just as mysteriously as the Nephite/Lamanite DNA,
            while their New World counterparts continued to deposit abundant evidence of their existence, just as they
            did with native human DNA, continuously across the entire timeline. The only domesticable animals in the New
            World at the time of the Book of Mormon were dogs and, in some locations, turkeys and the occasional duck,
            plus llamas and alpacas in South America, which is outside of any modern theory of Book of Mormon geography.
            The presence of large domesticable animals like cattle, sheep, horses, and pigs, which the Book of Mormon
            tells us “were for the use of men,” would have entirely revolutionized the agriculture and economy of the
            New World. Even if the Lehites did manage to die off without a trace, their neighbors would certainly have
            made extensive use of these extremely valuable domesticates, just as they did once they were actually
            introduced to the New World centuries later by European colonists. And they would have represented them in
            their art and mentioned them in their writing, as they did the many animals and plants that actually did
            inhabit their environment. As we've been saying through the church essays, <em>Occam's Razor</em> would tell
            you that the most obvious answer is that the Book of Mormon was written by someone who incorporated the
            things around them that they knew, but unfortunately not things that existed at the time.

            We should consider what Joseph Smith said about the peopling of the Americas and the identity of the
            American
            Indians in his description of the Book of Mormon: “In this important and interesting book the history of
            ancient America is unfolded, from its <strong>first settlement</strong> by a colony that came from the Tower
            of Babel at the
            confusion of languages to the beginning of the fifth century of the Christian era. We are informed by these
            records that America in ancient times has been inhabited by <strong> two distinct races </strong>of people.
            The first were
            called Jaredites and came directly from the Tower of Babel. The second race came directly from the city of
            Jerusalem about six hundred years before Christ. They were <strong>principally Israelites</strong> of the
            descendants of
            Joseph. The Jaredites were destroyed about the time that the Israelites came from Jerusalem, who succeeded
            them in the <strong>inheritance</strong> of the country. The principal nation of the second race fell in
            battle towards the
            close of the fourth century. <strong>The remnant are the Indians that now inhabit this country.</strong>”
            (The Wentworth
            Letter, <em>Ensign</em>, July, 2002). There is absolutely no wiggle room here, and the DNA studies and
            admissions in the essay make it clear that these words are simply not true.

            The idea of other people already inhabiting the Americas before the arrival of the Book of Mormon peoples
            simply is not possible in terms of what the Book of Mormon says about itself and what the prophets have said
            about it, something that was summarized succinctly by Apostle Mark E. Petersen as a self-evident fact: “If
            there had been large numbers of other peoples here when the Jaredites came, or when Lehi arrived, <strong>
                certainly
                the Book of Mormon would have said so </strong>. The land was reserved for the Lord’s purposes and for
            His peoples,
            and the Book of Mormon provides their histories.” (<em>Children of Promise</em>, Bookcraft, 1981).

                A brief review of the basic principles of genetics will help explain how scientists use DNA to study
                ancient
                populations. It will also highlight the difficulty of drawing conclusions about the Book of Mormon from
                the
                study of genetics.

            While the following portion of the essay is well-written and informative, it's crucial to highlight that
            <strong>it
                does not provide any actual evidence to support the Book of Mormon</strong>. Most of the essay serves as
            a basic
            introduction to population genetics, aiming to suggest multiple reasons why DNA evidence that supports the
            Book of Mormon might be absent. The goal seems to be to dissuade readers from confronting the serious
            implications of the existing DNA evidence, and to minimize the importance of scientific discoveries
            regarding the peopling of the Americas. However, the undeniable truth remains: all DNA evidence gathered so
            far indicates that there were no Middle Eastern populations in the Americas during Book of Mormon times.

                contain
                about 3.2 billion instructions. Any two individuals share approximately 99.9 percent of their genetic

            thousands of ancestors, and so provides a record that is much more robust against lineage loss, and presents

            There is, in fact, one excellent example of a non-Asian migration to America: the Viking settlement at
            L’Anse aux Meadows in Nova Scotia. A small group of Norsemen, probably about the size of Lehi’s family,
            briefly visited North America. However, unlike the millions of people proposed in the Book of Mormon, this
            tiny group of Vikings left behind abundant and undeniable evidence of their presence. The colony, which
            reached a population of no more than 100 people living in eight longhouses, left us numerous clues about who
            they were and how they lived. In contrast, there is zero definitive evidence of any of the populations
            described in the Book of Mormon.
            <br><br>
            For instance, we can still see where these Viking settlers built a forge and made a few hundred nails to
            repair their ships, all of which left clear evidence of their metallurgical activities. This raises the
            question: why is there no trace of the Book of Mormon metalsmiths, who allegedly produced thousands of
            swords and armor pieces for vast armies of Nephites and Jaredites? You might consider the apologetic
            argument that 'steel' actually referred to obsidian microblades, but that’s not what the text says. It
            specifically mentions steel and other metals that are absent from the archaeological record. The claim that
            such evidence would have entirely decayed is unsustainable in light of the Viking discoveries and other
            well-preserved antiquities, such as the recent discovery of 7,000-year-old sharpened wooden stakes in
            Florida (National Geographic News, Feb. 28, 2018).
            <br><br>
            Moreover, the idea that ancient weapons would simply disappear is contradicted by the claim that Laban’s
            sword remained intact until the 19th century. It’s also noteworthy that DNA from rodent remains found at
            L’Anse aux Meadows indicates that Norse rats stowed away on the Viking ships. How is it possible to find
            evidence from such a small settlement and yet find nothing from battles involving hundreds of thousands?

            <span class="essay-text">
                One reason it is difficult to use DNA evidence to draw definite conclusions about Book of Mormon peoples
                is that nothing is known about the DNA that Lehi, Sariah, Ishmael, and others brought to the Americas.
                Even if geneticists had a database of the DNA that now exists among all modern American Indian groups,
                it would be impossible to know exactly what to search for. It is possible that each member of the
                emigrating parties described in the Book of Mormon had DNA typical of the Near East, but it is likewise
                possible that some of them carried DNA more typical of other regions. In this case, their descendants
                might inherit a genetic profile that would be unexpected given their family’s place of origin.

        <p>
            The Book of Mormon clearly states that Lehi’s family were Israelites from Jerusalem. Are we now being asked
            to consider that the Lehites were actually descendants of Siberians who temporarily relocated to Jerusalem
            before building a ship and coming to America? An article on LDS.org titled 'Who and Where are the
            Lamanites?' explains: <em> 'In this composite group is the blood of Israel, for we know that Lehi was of the
                tribe of Manasseh (see Alma 10:3), that Ishmael was of Ephraim (see JD 3:184), and that Mulek was of
                Judah,
                being a descendant of King David through Zedekiah.'</em> (Who and Where Were the Lamanites?, Ensign,
            1975).
            <br><br>
            The author of this essay is attempting to deflect and sidetrack the main issue with concerns that we don’t
            have DNA from any specific individuals on Nephi’s boat. However, this is not a criminal case where we need
            to match a specific person through DNA profiling. Instead, we are studying population genetics. If we accept
            the Book of Mormon’s account of its origins, we know that one of its founders, Mulek, was the son of King
            Zedekiah of Jerusalem—a well-documented lineage. What more evidence could you ask for? Joseph Smith told us,
            <em> 'They were principally Israelites of the descendants of Joseph</em>.' (The Wentworth Letter, Ensign,
            July 2002).
            We also know that one of the reasons Lehi needed the Brass Plates was because they contained his genealogy,
            and the Book of Mormon tells us that he was a descendant of Joseph. Therefore, the idea that unusual,
            foreign DNA might be present is simply a distraction designed to create wiggle room.
            <br><br>
            The real strength of population genetics lies in determining the origins and migrations of groups of people,
            not in identifying them as individuals. You may not know who your ancestors were or where they lived 2,000
            years ago, but by sending a cheek swab and $99 to 23AndMe.com, they can tell you the regions your ancestors
            came from. It’s that simple today. They don’t need to know who your great-great-great-grandfather was, and
            they can even tell you what percentage of your genome comes from Neanderthals (likely 1-3%). In the same
            way, we can determine quite accurately where Native Americans originated. If we take the Book of Mormon at
            face value regarding the peopling of the New World, and consider the Doctrine and Covenants’ identification
            of North American Indians as Lamanites, we shouldn’t need to look beyond the DNA of the nearest Native
            American to find evidence of Israelites.

                Consider the case of Dr. Ugo A. Perego, a Latter-day Saint population geneticist. His genealogy confirms
                that he is a multigeneration Italian, but the DNA of his paternal genetic lineage is from a branch of
                the Asian/Native American haplogroup C. This likely means that, somewhere along the line, a migratory
                event from Asia to Europe led to the introduction of DNA atypical of Perego’s place of origin.<a

            (Except that they would also see the Italian component of his DNA, but once again this is the exact opposite
            of what this essay is claiming about Book of Mormon peoples. It turns out that Dr. Perego really does have
            Asian markers in his paternal line, even though his ancestors arrived in Italy many generations ago. Dr.
            Perego was originally laboring under a misconception about his own origins until genetic testing provided
            the fuller picture. He didn’t need a tissue sample from a distant ancestor to answer the question for him.
            Why is it that he trusts the science in his own case, and has changed his mind about his ancestry
            accordingly, but doesn’t allow us the same option with the Book of Mormon? His previous belief has been
            shown to be false and he now accepts the new scientific evidence. But what if Dr. Perego instead insisted
            that his paternal ancestors were Middle Eastern, even though his DNA said they were Asian/Native American?
            Who should we believe? We must follow the evidence consistently, just as Dr. Perego did for his own genetic
            ancestry, and not allow a special exception for the Book of Mormon. This essay is designed to create any
            doubt about DNA and science because the evidence undermines the entire premise of the Book of Mormon.)

            It is worth emphasizing once again that the authors of this essay face a much larger challenge than merely
            convincing members that Native Americans are not the Lamanites of the Book of Mormon. They must also
            convince the scriptures themselves, as they consistently identify Native Americans as Lamanites.
            Furthermore, the stated purpose of the Book of Mormon is to convert the remnant of Lehi's children. The
            book's title page explicitly states it is “ <em> written to the Lamanites, who are a remnant of the house of
                Israel. </em>” Are we now to believe that the book was created by God specifically for a people who,
            according to
            this essay, became extinct before they had the opportunity to receive it?
            <br><br>
            Consider the following passages from the Doctrine and Covenants, where God seemingly mistakes the American
            Indians for Lamanites. This misunderstanding was shared by all of us, as it was actively taught until DNA
            studies made it unsustainable:

            Where exactly are these Lamanites, to whom we are commanded to take the gospel? Either the DNA evidence is
            entirely wrong (which the essay does not dispute, despite attempting to create some wiggle room), or the
            revelations in the Doctrine and Covenants, as outlined above, are not true. Occam's Razor suggests the
            simplest explanation: that the Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants are incorrect.
            <br><br>
            In addition to the voice of God in the D&C, we also have the statements of modern prophets, seers, and
            revelators. President Gordon B. Hinckley confirmed the identity of the native peoples of the Americas as
            Lamanites during the dedication of the Ciudad Juárez Temple, when he said, <em> “May the sons and daughters
                of
                Father Lehi grow in strength and fulfillment of the ancient promises made concerning them”</em> (LDS
            Church News,
            March 13, 1999). Elder James E. Faust echoed this sentiment during the dedication of the Tuxtla Gutiérrez,
            Mexico Temple: <em>“We invoke thy blessings upon this nation of Mexico where so many of the sons and
                daughters
                of Father Lehi dwell”</em> (LDS Church News, March 18, 2000). Similarly, President Thomas S. Monson
            referred to
            attendees at the Villahermosa, Mexico Temple dedication as “children of Lehi” (LDS Church News, May 27,
            2000), and President Hinckley spoke of the members attending the Guayaquil, Ecuador Temple as having
            <em>“the
                blood of Lehi in their veins”</em> (LDS Church News, August 7, 1999).
            <br><br>
            President Spencer W. Kimball spearheaded the Indian Placement Program with the belief that the Lamanites
            among us could have their curse removed and become <em>“white and delightsome”</em> again. Of this program,
            he said,
            <em>“The day of the Lamanites is nigh. For years they have been growing delightsome, and they are now
                becoming
                white and delightsome... The children in the home placement program in Utah are often lighter than their
                brothers and sisters in the hogans on the reservation”</em> (The Improvement Era, December 1960,
            922-23).
            <br><br>
            The situation becomes even more complex when we consider the inhabitants of the Pacific Islands, whom
            prophets and apostles have also claimed are descendants of Lehi, through Hagoth, the Book of Mormon’s
            shipbuilder. President David O. McKay confirmed this in his dedicatory prayer for the New Zealand Temple:
            <em>“We express gratitude that to these fertile Islands Thou didst guide descendants of Father Lehi.”</em>
            This opens
            an entirely different can of DNA worms that completely undermines the essay's thesis. Official church
            manuals have consistently taught that the native peoples of the Americas and the Pacific Islands are
            Lamanites: <em>“Great numbers of Lamanites in North and South America and the South Pacific are now
                receiving
                the blessings of the gospel”</em> (Gospel Principles, 1997, p. 268). Grouping Polynesians and Native
            Americans
            into a single lineage negates any attempt by this essay to address the DNA issues specific to Native
            Americans. The DNA of Pacific Islanders indicates that they originated from a different part of Asia than
            Native Americans (Nature, October 3, 2016). Additionally, the islands identified by modern prophets as being
            populated by Hagoth’s descendants were actually settled long after Book of Mormon times. For example, humans
            did not arrive in New Zealand until the 14th century AD—800 years after Moroni buried the gold plates.
            <br><br>
            This is not merely an error of misguided church manual writers; it is established doctrine. Brigham Young
            first said, <em>“Those islanders and the natives of this country (United States) are of the House of Israel,
                of
                the seed of Abraham” </em>(Journals of Religious History 8:90-104), and many other leaders have
            reiterated this
            idea. The scriptures, along with every prophet and leader, consistently identify Native Americans as
            Lamanites. We now know this is not the case. While this essay attempts to downplay this fact, it
            fundamentally undermines the authenticity of the Book of Mormon and Joseph Smith’s role as a true prophet of
            God.

                Population bottleneck is the loss of genetic variation that occurs when a natural disaster, epidemic
                disease, massive war, or other calamity results in the death of a substantial part of a population.
                These
                events may severely reduce or totally eliminate certain genetic profiles. In such cases, a population
                may
                regain genetic diversity over time through mutation, but much of the diversity that previously existed
                is
                irretrievably lost.

            This is an interesting argument because the arrival of the first Americans across Beringia is a textbook
            example of a genetic bottleneck. It is widely accepted that a small group of people either passed through a
            briefly open corridor between ice sheets or followed a coastal route. This group then spread rapidly
            throughout the Americas over a period of about 2,000 years, flourishing until the arrival of European
            conquerors. If a genetic bottleneck posed such a dire problem, their DNA should be a complete mystery due to
            mutations over the intervening millennia. Yet, we can still easily trace their genetic lineage directly back
            to Siberia and the Mal'ta skeleton from 24,000 years ago, despite the founder effect, the bottleneck, and a
            timescale much deeper than that of the Book of Mormon.
            <br><br>
            If the consequences of the bottleneck and founder effect were truly so severe, one of the greatest mysteries
            in science today would be determining the origins of the people of the Americas. But that’s not the case.
            Yes, some mutations cause the loss of individual genetic base pairs, particularly those that don't
            contribute to the organism's survival, but the vast majority of genetic material is passed down from
            generation to generation.

            Yes, the genetic pressures on ancient Americans did alter their genetic structure, but in a measurable and
            understandable way. Are we really expected to believe that European diseases and warfare specifically and
            exclusively 'squeezed out' only the Nephite, Lamanite, Jaredite, and Mulekite elements while leaving behind
            ample evidence, thousands of years older, of solely non-Book-of-Mormon lineages? That is quite a leap in
            logic.
            <br><br>
            Additionally, DNA has been sequenced from ancient archaeological remains of many individuals predating these
            wars, including the 8,500-year-old Kennewick Man* from the American Northwest, and individuals from
            12,000–13,000 years ago in Montana and the Yucatan, as well as people from Book of Mormon times. These
            findings present a consistent picture: a continuous presence of Siberian-descended ancient peoples
            throughout the Americas right up to modern times, with no trace of Middle Eastern genetic intrusion. If
            that's not convincing enough, we can still measure the Neanderthal DNA in Native Americans dating back over
            40,000 years. This demonstrates how persistent DNA is and how difficult it is for the genetic lineage of
            large populations to be erased.
            <br><br>
            I don’t want to stray too far from the topic, but I should mention the additional significance of Kennewick
            Man. The Heartland movement, which advocates for a North American setting for the Book of Mormon, claims
            that the discovery of the Western Eurasian haplogroup X in modern North American Natives is conclusive
            evidence supporting the Book of Mormon. However, it’s important to remember that Kennewick Man’s genome also
            contains haplogroup X, yet he died thousands of years before the events of the Book of Mormon. (Nature, 23

                Draw

                generations
                and shows how drift can result in the loss of genetic profiles. The effect of drift is especially
                pronounced
                in small, isolated populations or in cases where a small group carrying a distinct genetic profile
                intermingles with a much larger population of a different lineage.

            (We were just told that the Book of Mormon peoples were small segregated groups that were killed off by
            catastrophe, but now they’re telling you the opposite, that they were intermingled out of existence. That's
            another deceptive theory in these LDS essays to try to find wiggle room to explain away big problems.)
        </p>

        <p>
            The problem here is that this illustration is deceptively oversimplified. It’s easy to imagine how 10
            marbles can be removed from a jar of 20 by random extraction—I even tried this experiment myself, and here’s
            what I learned. Assuming each time you draw a marble from the jar represents one generation, it takes around
            25-50 generations to eliminate the red marbles. That seems to support their case, right? But what happens if
            you double the number of marbles? If you use 20 of each color, it turns out it doesn’t take twice as many
            generations, but four times as many. The increase appears to be geometric.
            <br><br>
            This marble experiment is a grotesquely simplified representation of the real issue, because the human
            genome doesn’t contain just 20 base pairs but 30 billion! Imagine doing this experiment with a jar the size
            of Texas holding 30 billion marbles, and you can only take one out per generation. After a few centuries,
            you’d find that you've barely made any progress in removing marbles of either color—and this assumes there
            are no "red marble" people contributing at all, only "blue marble" people. The odds of this process working
            on such a scale are astronomical, making it virtually impossible within the timeframe we’re discussing. One
            geneticist even described the scenario as being as likely as “throwing a pizza against a wall and having it
            emerge intact on the other side.” (Eric Fairfield, Mormon Stories Podcast, episode 571).
            <br><br>
            Like bottlenecks and the founder effect, the peopling of the Americas provides a perfect laboratory for
            studying genetic drift. Genetic drift did occur, which explains why Native Americans have a unique set of
            haplotypes and different skull morphology compared to their ancient Siberian ancestors. However, even in
            15,000 years, their DNA hasn't mutated enough to obscure their origin as descendants of the Beringia Land
            Bridge migrants, as acknowledged in this essay. Consider the 24,000-year-old Siberian child mentioned in the
            footnotes, whose DNA lineage is directly linked to modern Native Americans. In contrast, the Lehites arrived
            only 2,600 years ago. Why should we assume that Nephite/Lamanite DNA would have mutated 10 times faster or
            been “squeezed” out at 10 times the rate of these older populations?
            <br><br>
            The same issues apply to the peoples of Oceania. We’ve seen modern prophets claim that Polynesians descend
            from Lehi through Hagoth, yet their DNA traces back to Asia, through a completely different lineage than
            that of Native Americans. In fact, new DNA findings trace Polynesians all the way back to Mesolithic-era
            Asians. Are we to believe that the Book of Mormon ancestry of Pacific Islanders disappeared in exactly the
            same way as their American counterparts, leaving only evidence of non-Book of Mormon Asian origins in
            Polynesia? Each island’s settlement re-enacted the conditions of Nephi's voyage, so we must accept that, in
            every case, only the essential Book of Mormon DNA vanished, leaving behind only the DNA of the “other”
            people who coincidentally were also there.
            <br><br>
            This leaves two insurmountable problems. First, Polynesian DNA differs significantly from Native American
            DNA (so they both couldn’t be Lamanites). Second, many of the islanders that church leaders have identified
            as descendants of Lehi live on islands that weren’t even settled during Book of Mormon times. Much like the
            LDS essays on the Book of Abraham, polygamy/polyandry, and the translation of the Book of Mormon, this essay
            requires members to completely reconstruct the church’s history to make it work. This is why these essays
            collectively paint such a troubling picture of Joseph Smith's credibility as a prophet and, by extension,
            the authenticity of the Book of Mormon.

                A study in Iceland combining both genetic and genealogical data demonstrates that the majority of people

            still genetically Icelandic. Also, Iceland is the exact opposite of the case that this essay is arguing.
            Iceland was a very isolated population that did NOT interbreed with a larger population. Now try to imagine
            how credible the story would sound if it claimed that Iceland was once inhabited by large numbers of
            Israelites who originated in Jerusalem, but now all genetic evidence of them had been specifically and
            completely “squeezed” out, leaving only that of Scandinavians. Just as startling, these Israelites are not
            mentioned in the histories and sagas of the Icelanders, nor did they leave any archaeological, linguistic or
            other evidence of their existence or of the domesticated animals and crops that they supposedly brought with

                Genetic drift particularly affects mitochondrial DNA and Y-chromosome DNA, but it also leads to the loss
                of variation in autosomal DNA. When a small population mixes with a large one, combinations of autosomal
                markers typical of the smaller group become rapidly overwhelmed or swamped by those of the larger. The
                smaller group’s markers soon become rare in the combined population and may go extinct due to the
                effects of genetic drift and bottlenecks as described above.

                This can make the combinations of markers characteristic of the smaller group so diluted that they

            This essay attempts to support its claim that we shouldn’t expect to find any evidence of Book of Mormon
            peoples by presenting a couple of examples (Iceland and Dr. Perego’s own ancestry). Now, let’s examine some
            real-world cases that are highly relevant to the Book of Mormon narrative:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>The Lemba people, a tribe of black Africans in Zimbabwe, claim to be Jews who migrated from the Middle
                East
                during the Babylonian invasion—much like the Lehites. Despite being physically indistinguishable from
                their
                African neighbors, DNA testing in the late 1990s and early 2000s found strong and direct genetic links
                between
                the Lemba and Jews/Arabs from the time and place the Lemba claim to have originated. This directly
                contradicts
                the essay’s claim that we should expect no genetic evidence. The Lemba are, without question, of Middle
                Eastern
                Jewish origin, just as their tradition asserts (Spurdle, A. B. (1996). The origins of the Lemba 'Black

                DNA analysis of aboriginal Australians reveals the presence of Indian DNA, indicating an
                interbreeding event around 4,200 years ago (which corresponds to the Jaredite timeframe). Archaeological
                evidence, including the introduction of dogs and new weaponry, further supports this migration. In
                contrast, the
                Book of Mormon claims that its founders brought steel, crops, and domesticated animals to the Americas,
                yet
                there is no corroborating DNA or archaeological evidence to support this claim (Pugach, I., Delfin, F.,
                Gunnarsdóttir, E., Kayser, M., & Stoneking, M. (2013). Genome-wide data substantiate Holocene gene flow

                The Denisovans were a distinct Asian culture from around 40,000 years ago. Recent studies have found
                Denisovan
                DNA in the genetic lineage of people across the Pacific Islands. This contradicts the genetic bottleneck
                and
                founder effect theories used to explain the absence of Book of Mormon DNA. Despite the Denisovan
                presence being
                traced back 40,000 years, no trace of the supposed descendants of Hagoth and his crew, who are said to
                have
                founded Polynesian societies, can be found (Reich, D. (2011). Denisova admixture and the first modern

                DNA and archaeological studies of ancient American dogs show that dogs arrived in the Americas with
                trans-Beringian travelers over 10,000 years ago. Despite the Book of Mormon’s claim that Old World
                animals and
                seeds were introduced and successfully raised in the Americas, no evidence supports the existence of
                these
                species before the Spanish conquest (Leonard, J. (2002). Ancient DNA evidence for Old World origin of

        <p>
            We must question why the essay's explanations for the disappearance of Book of Mormon DNA don’t apply to
            these
            real-world examples. If genetic drift and bottlenecks were severe enough to erase all evidence of the Book
            of
            Mormon peoples, we shouldn’t expect to find cases like those described above.
            <br><br>
            Now, let’s consider another significant issue that this essay avoids addressing. On June 4, 1834, during
            Zion’s
            Camp march, Joseph Smith wrote a letter to Emma, stating that they were “wandering over the plains of the
            Nephites, recounting occasionally the history of the Book of Mormon, roving over the mounds of that once
            beloved
            people of the Lord, picking up their skulls & their bones, as a proof of its divine authenticity…” (The
            Personal
            Writings of Joseph Smith, Deseret Book, 1984, 324). Joseph identified one set of bones as belonging to
            Zelph, a
            white Lamanite whose skin had turned white due to righteousness. The burial mound where Zelph was found, now
            known as Naples Mound 8 near Griggsville, Illinois, should excite Mormon apologists. Joseph provided the
            exact
            location to find DNA evidence of Nephites and Lamanites, who died long before European warfare and disease
            introduced a genetic bottleneck. So, why aren’t church-employed anthropologists and geneticists examining
            these
            remains to validate the Book of Mormon? Why aren’t BYU archaeologists actively excavating the region around
            Griggsville? Instead, they seem to ignore this physical evidence in favor of deflective theories like those
            presented in the essay. This is likely because no traces of Nephites or Lamanites—white or otherwise—can be
            found in Illinois. Either Joseph Smith fabricated these stories (some argue he liked to impress people with
            grandiose tales), or God set him up to appear fraudulent, considering the DNA issues, the incorrect Book of
            Abraham translation, and various other problems with the Book of Mormon, including King James Bible
            translation
            errors, anachronisms, and Deutero-Isaiah timeline discrepancies.

            The Church demands that we believe in the literal, physical claims of the Book of Mormon (and the Book of
            Abraham). We test these claims, and they fail. Apologists then step in, offering alternative theories
            designed to help us maintain belief in the literalness of the book’s claims, while simultaneously
            discouraging us from expecting any tangible evidence, or worse, trying to explain away the evidence we do
            have. Ultimately, these essays always conclude with the reminder that faith is the deciding factor. If you
            struggle with certain teachings or are troubled by contradicting evidence, the blame is placed on you—your
            lack of conviction or sincerity, or allowing yourself to be deceived by the adversary. They assure you that
            if you pray with a sincere heart, your lifetime of church experiences will guide you to know it's still true
            despite the evidence. But if you pray and don’t receive that confirmation after reading their notes, you’re
            told that it’s because you didn’t pray with enough sincerity and, therefore, weren’t open to receiving
            personal revelation.
            <br><br>
            They then ask you to watch a video showing spiritual confirmations from people of various denominations,
            including Mormons, Muslims, and members of other non-mainstream religions and groups. At the 10-minute mark,
            there’s a segment on an LDS offshoot where a teenage girl enters polygamy and bears testimony that it is of
            God. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJMSU8Qj6Go&feature=youtu.be">link to video</a>)
            <br><br>
            If you’re genuinely striving to know the truth, how can you reach that answer when the Church continually
            changes its claims about the Book of Mormon? Professors lead you down convoluted, non-doctrinal paths, with
            the goalposts constantly moving. For a clear understanding of the Church's actual doctrines on the peopling
            of the Americas, I recommend Jeffrey R. Holland’s <a
                href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1976/06/a-promised-land?lang=eng">Ensign article, A Promised Land</a>.
            Of course, this was
            written before molecular biology came along and completely undermined that narrative.
            <br><br>
            You might want to read this article alongside the version of history presented in these essays to fully
            grasp the mental gymnastics at play. Don’t fall into the trap of excusing this as Elder Holland
            <em>‘speaking as
                a man’</em> or offering his own opinion. He is simply reiterating the words of prophets, official Church
            materials, and the Book of Mormon itself.
            <br><br>
            In his article, Elder Holland describes an ancient North America that wasn’t yet separated by plate
            tectonics from the Old World, around 6,000 years ago when Adam and Eve lived in what is now Missouri. This
            would have been long after the arrival of the ‘other’ people, as this essay acknowledges, who came from
            Asia—an entire continent that doesn’t exist in Elder Holland’s version of events. Elder Holland further
            explains how God wiped the land clean during the Great Flood (though somehow the Siberian immigrants
            survived) and only afterward physically separated the Americas from the rest of the world to keep it
            uncontaminated by human habitation. He states, ‘Such a special place needed now to be kept apart from other
            regions, free from the indiscriminate traveler as well as the soldier of fortune. To guarantee such
            sanctity, the very surface of the earth was rent. In response to God’s decree, the great continents
            separated, and the ocean rushed in to surround them. The promised place was set apart. Without habitation,
            it waited for the fulfillment of God’s special purposes.’ Brother Holland then adds, ‘With care and
            selectivity, the Lord began almost at once to repeople the promised land,’ telling the story of the arrival
            of the Jaredites and then the Nephites to this pristine, unoccupied land.
            <br><br>
            This narrative is dramatically different from the one revealed to us by unbiased scientific research, and
            also from the version presented in this essay. This creates a major problem, much like we see with the Book
            of Abraham, polygamy, and the translation of the Book of Mormon. We have contradictory histories, both of
            which come from the Church and are approved by the First Presidency. Which are we supposed to believe? If
            you receive spiritual confirmation about one, does that invalidate the confirmation you received about the
            other? It feels as though we are being presented with multiple contradictory stories and expected to choose
            whichever one suits us, regardless of its truth. Faith, after all, is belief without evidence—not belief in
            spite of evidence.
            <br><br>
            The title page of the Book of Mormon, written by Moroni, states that the book was <em> <strong>‘written to
                    the Lamanites,
                    who are a remnant of the house of Israel</strong>… that they may know the covenants of the Lord,
                that they are not
                cast off forever.’</em> However, this essay asks us to believe that there are no longer any Lamanites,
            rendering
            this purpose of the Book of Mormon unachievable. Nephi beheaded Laban and took the brass plates so that a
            nation would not ‘dwindle and perish in unbelief,’ yet not only have the peoples of the Book of Mormon
            dwindled in unbelief, according to this essay, they’ve perished and completely disappeared from the earth.
            Apparently, they did exist at one time—millions of them—but now they have been entirely erased beyond the
            power of God or science to ever recover. Meanwhile, a continent full of ‘other’ people—who are a perfect
            match for the Book of Mormon’s description of Lamanites in skin color, clothing, and other traits—are
            declared to be completely unrelated and consistently misidentified by both the Lord and His prophets.
            <br><br>
            To complicate matters further, the Church released a new video in 2018, long after this essay was published,
            telling Native American members that they really are <em><strong>‘descended from the Book of Mormon
                    people’</strong></em> (Children of
            Promise, The Mormon Channel). It’s troubling that the Church hides this essay deep within its website while
            simultaneously promoting a message in videos that they know to be false. This pattern is something we’ve
            seen throughout the history of the Book of Mormon translation, and one has to wonder why the Church refuses
            to present an honest portrayal of its foundational narrative to those investigating the faith.
            <br><br>
            As someone who went through the missionary discussions, I can attest that the history presented there looks
            and sounds nothing like the admissions found in these essays. Yet the Church continues to present itself
            this way because the truth would undermine the credibility and authenticity of Joseph Smith and the Book of
            Mormon. Having gone through those discussions, classes, and lessons, I can’t stress enough how devastating
            it feels to discover that you were lied to for years about basic facts the Church now admits it has long
            been aware of. If these annotated essays seem harsh in tone, please understand that it stems from the deep
            sense of betrayal and shock that arises when realizing that the same Church that demands honesty from you
            about your income, clothing choices, eating and drinking habits, and sex life refuses to offer you that same
            honesty about its own foundational history and the Book of Mormon.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our takeaway from this essay is that the authors did not present a single shred of evidence for the Book of
            Mormon. They did, however, make a lot of excuses for the lack of evidence, they overlooked a lot of
            problematic contradictory evidence, and they did their best to downplay a serious scientific issue that
            significantly impacts the historicity of the book. To come away from this essay feeling that you have been
            given a satisfying answer you must accept that:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                The Jaredites, Mulekites, and Lehites arrived in a new land that was already heavily populated.
            </li>
            <li>
                The people they encountered were the ancestors of modern Native Americans. However, according to the
                Bible, Doctrine and Covenants, and statements by modern prophets and General Authorities, these people
                could not be descendants of Adam and Eve, as they predate them by thousands of years.
            </li>
            <li>
                These "other" people somehow survived the Great Flood, even though it was sent by God specifically to
                cleanse such populations from the American continents in preparation for His chosen people.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Book of Mormon fails to mention these people, their cities, their agriculture, military presence,
                writing systems, religion, and trade networks, despite providing detailed descriptions of animals and
                plants for which there is no evidence in the Americas.
            </li>
            <li>
                Our prophets, seers, and revelators, as well as our scriptures (i.e., God), are mistaken about the
                identity and origins of both Native Americans and Polynesians.</li>
            <li>
                The vast civilizations described in the Book of Mormon vanished without a trace, while evidence of their
                neighbors' civilizations is widespread and easily found.
            </li>
            <li>
                We are expected to give more weight to the justifications presented in this essay than to the physical,
                testable evidence or the words of the prophets and the Lord in scripture.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The First Presidency, or anyone else for that matter, does not attach their names or reputations to this
            material. Should we take it seriously, or is it merely an attempt to divert attention from inconvenient
            evidence and an insurmountable problem for the Book of Mormon? It is hearsay and, in light of what the
            scriptures and prophets have said, possibly heresy. Isn't it telling that this is the best answer the First
            Presidency can offer to address the issues of Book of Mormon historicity?
            <br><br>
            So why does the Church publish essays like this? Because the internet and DNA studies have forced them to,
            and any answer is better than no answer. If they make no attempt to respond, the only answers you’ll find
            are from scientific investigators (whose conclusions are based solely on logic and reason—two things the
            essay seems to warn us against). These investigators have no agenda other than uncovering the truth. DNA
            studies do not carry an anti-Mormon bias; they rely on empirical data and are supported by visible evidence.
            Remember, apologetics is only necessary when the facts are not in your favor. If the prophet and apostles
            truly endorse these ideas, it would be valuable to hear them make these claims directly and support them
            with solid, on-the-record explanations. This essay, however, functions more as an intellectual distraction
            from the facts presented by scientists and scholars who, rather than being enemies of the Church, are simply
            pursuing truth with no concern for what is or isn’t written in the Book of Mormon. Perhaps these essays
            remain anonymous to allow the Church and its leaders to maintain a safe distance in case they need to
            disavow them in favor of a new approach.
            <br><br>
            One last thought about apologetics and the Church’s approach to these essays: Imagine if I offered you a
            version of the Book of Mormon that made the opposite claim about its people. Suppose it told the story of
            ancient Americans arriving in Jerusalem by boat from the New World. Upon arrival, they found tapirs,
            monkeys, macaws, cacao, and other things that have left no trace of ever existing in the Old World. The book
            would describe how these people grew into mighty nations, built numerous cities, and fought genocidal wars
            with armies larger than any in history, using weapons that have disappeared from the archaeological record.
            You would likely want to see some evidence to support such a claim. You might point out that not only the
            archaeology but also the DNA of people in the Holy Land should show extensive evidence of such a migration.
            How should I address your concerns? One option would be to give you this very essay, but with the place
            names reversed. The defense presented here could just as easily support the claim that Jerusalem was founded
            by ancient Native Americans as it does the Book of Mormon’s claim that boats traveled the opposite
            direction. This is because the essay offers no supporting evidence for the Book of Mormon’s authenticity; it
            exists purely to excuse the glaring lack of evidence and the presence of sound contradictory evidence.
            <br><br>
            A tactic used in these essays is to divide and conquer your doubts—they take on each topic one at a time,
            and then break each one down. In statistics, when calculating the probability of several scenarios occurring
            together, you multiply the individual probabilities. Let’s apply this to the essays:
            <br><br>
            The odds that a population of 1-3 million people would leave no DNA evidence of their existence are probably
            one in a million (and that’s being generous). The odds that the same 1-3 million people would leave no
            physical evidence? Let’s be generous again and say 1 in 10,000. The odds that the Book of Abraham is
            divinely inspired, even though it’s been improperly translated and the text itself refers to incorrectly
            translated facsimiles? We’ll say 1 in 1,000.
            <br><br>
            Just these three scenarios occurring together result in a probability of 0.0000000000001% (and that doesn’t
            even account for other issues raised in these essays). This illustrates the broader problem these essays
            face: DNA evidence presents a massive challenge and is considered by many to be a “smoking gun” against the
            authenticity of the Book of Mormon and Joseph Smith. But DNA is just one of several problems that don’t hold
            up over time. Critics like myself point out that Joseph Smith couldn’t have known we’d have DNA testing one
            day, which is why he made casual claims like Zelph being a Lamanite. He likely never thought we’d have the
            ability to translate ancient Egyptian texts, which is why he declared the mummy scrolls to be scriptures
            from Abraham and Joseph. He probably didn’t anticipate that we would one day confirm there were no horses,
            cattle, chariots, wheels, wheat, silk, steel, iron, goats, or swine during Book of Mormon times when writing
            the book. Nor could he have known that we’d be able to scan the Hill Cumorah and find no caves, no plates,
            and no bones from epic battles, despite his claims that the Hill in New York was the very same Hill Cumorah
            from the Book of Mormon. Similarly, he likely didn’t expect that the Kinderhook Plates, which he claimed
            came from a “descendant of Ham,” would later be proven a hoax.
            <br><br>
            We could continue, but I hope the point is clear. For all of these things to have happened as Joseph Smith
            claimed, one must suspend belief in what we now understand about the world and the history of the Church,
            much of which is reluctantly acknowledged in these essays. In this particular essay, you would need to
            reject the very science that has led to treatments for cancer and other diseases. We cannot pick and choose
            which parts of science to believe based on what conflicts with Joseph Smith’s writings, which, as even
            Richard Bushman admits, were rooted in 19th-century beliefs.
            <br><br>
            We know this information is difficult to read and even harder to accept. But after months of research, these
            conclusions have not been drawn lightly, nor are they based on random assumptions. Please don’t accept the
            Church’s theories on these topics without question—and don’t accept ours blindly either. Do your own
            research, including both LDS and non-LDS sources. It is not wicked to investigate the Church’s claims, nor
            is it apostasy to question why the evidence before us doesn’t align with the narrative the Church continues
            to present.
            <br><br>
            This is a painful conclusion to reach, but it is better to find the truth than to ignore it, no matter how
            difficult it may be. There are many resources to help those experiencing a crisis of faith, so feel free to
            email us if you’d like assistance. While the Church tells us we will be miserable without it (and asks,
            "Where will you go?"), that’s the kind of statement made by someone in an abusive relationship. The notion
            that happiness is impossible without the Church is insulting, especially given the issues highlighted by
            these essays. In reality, people who learn the truth and move on are often just as happy and healthy—if not
            more so. I can personally say that I’ve been better off since leaving: I feel more confident, I choose to do
            what’s right because I want to, not because I’m told to, and contrary to Church teachings, I don’t live in
            sin or laziness. There is life after the Church, and while leaving something you were raised to believe is
            the only way can be hard, finding the truth and enjoying the world and people around you is more than worth
            it.

                        1992): 1–34. These arguments were summarized more recently in John L. Sorenson,

                        2013). Sorenson suggests that indicators in the book’s text makes it “inescapable that there
                        were substantial populations in the ‘promised land’ throughout the period of the Nephite
                        record, and probably in the Jaredite era also” (“When Lehi’s Party Arrived,” 34). Though
                        there are several plausible hypotheses regarding the geographic locations of Book of Mormon
                        events, the Church takes no official position except that the events occurred in the
                        Americas. <cite>See Book of Mormon Seminary Teacher Manual</cite> (2012): 196.
