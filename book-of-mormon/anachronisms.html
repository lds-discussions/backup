        <h1>Dating the Book of Mormon: Scholarly Perspectives and Historical Context</h1>

        <p>
            In these sections on the Book of Mormon, I have aimed to highlight the various ways scholars demonstrate
            that the Book of Mormon is undeniably a 19th-century document. By examining why it is dated to this time,
            I’ve also identified elements within the text that reveal Joseph Smith’s influence, making it clear that he
            is the author.
            <br>
            In the previous section, I discussed the external influences Joseph Smith incorporated into the Book of
            Mormon. These influences not only help date the text to Smith’s lifetime (e.g., the Moundbuilders myth, fear
            of the Masons) but also reveal personal experiences reflected in the narrative (such as Joseph Smith Sr.’s
            dream compared to Lehi’s dream, the Charles Anthon visit, and the loss of the 116 pages).
            <br><br>
            In this section, I will briefly explore additional ways the text itself provides evidence for dating the
            Book of Mormon to the 19th century. This includes identifying anachronisms and pointing out important
            elements that should be present in a text about ancient America but are notably absent.
            <br><br>
            Lastly, I will touch on some key Mormon doctrines that are missing from the Book of Mormon, shedding light
            on the development of Joseph Smith’s theology after the book was completed.
            <br><br>
            While there are extensive lists of anachronisms in the CES Letter, the CES Letter’s response to FAIR Mormon,
            and Letter For My Wife, this overview will focus on just a few key examples.
        </p>

        <h3>The King James Bible</h3>

        <p>
            Without a doubt the easiest way to date the Book of Mormon is to look at the King James Bible. I’ve covered
            this in a number of overviews already, but if you haven’t read our section on the King James Bible and the
            Book of Mormon, that is a much longer overview of this problem.
            <br><br>
            The Book of Mormon is literarily dependent on the King James Bible – there is simply no way around it.
            Typically apologists point to Doctrine and Covenants 1:24 as an explanation for this problem:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “Behold, I am God and have spoken it; these commandments are of me, and were given unto my servants in their
            weakness, after the manner of their language, that they might come to understanding.”
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            FAIR Mormon’s response about KJV issues expands on this verse from D&C 1 a bit more:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “When considering the the data, Skousen proposes that, instead of Joseph or Oliver looking at a Bible, that
            God was simply able to provide the page of text from the King James Bible to Joseph's mind and then Joseph
            was free to alter the text as he pleased. In those cases where the Book of Mormon simply alludes to or
            echoes KJV language, perhaps the Lord allowed these portions of the text to be revealed in such a way that
            they would be more comprehensible/comfortable to his 19th century, Northeastern, frontier audience. This
            theology of translation may feel foreign and a bit strange to some Latter-day Saints, but it seems to fit
            well with the Lord's own words about the nature of revelation to Joseph Smith. The Lord speaks to his
            servants "after the manner of their language that they may come to understanding" (Doctrine and Covenants
            1:24). Latter-day Saints should take comfort in fact that the Lord accommodates his perfection to our own
            weakness and uses our imperfect language and nature for the building up of Zion on the earth.” (<a
                href="https://www.fairmormon.org/answers/Book_of_Mormon/Translation_Errors_from_the_KJV">FAIR Mormon,
                Translation errors in the King James Bible appearing in the Book of Mormon</a>)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            It's obvious that if God were to speak to us, it would be in our own language—communicating in an ancient or
            foreign language would lead to confusion and misunderstanding regarding what is being commanded or revealed.
            <br><br>
            That said, FAIR takes the phrase from Doctrine and Covenants 1:24 and expands its meaning to create a
            solution, rather than addressing the actual issues. The debate isn’t about Joseph Smith receiving
            revelations “after the manner of their language that they may come to understanding,” but rather that Joseph
            Smith used King James language while also incorporating its errors, mistranslations, and anachronisms into
            the text.
            <br><br>
            Additionally, when reading <a
                href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1?lang=eng">Doctrine and
                Covenants 1 in context</a>, it's clear that verse 24 refers to the Book
            of Commandments, not the Book of Mormon. This becomes evident because the Book of Mormon isn’t mentioned
            until verse 29:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            And after having received the record of the Nephites, yea, even my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., might have
            power to translate through the mercy of God, by the power of God, the Book of Mormon.”
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            The key point of this revelation is that God communicates in a language we understand so that we can follow
            His instructions. However, it does nothing to address the presence of King James Bible errors in the Book of
            Mormon, nor does it explain why King James-specific language is used in the first place.
            <br><br>
            This distinction is crucial because it's a common apologetic response to this issue—an issue that represents
            one of the most significant anachronisms, dating the Book of Mormon as a modern text. The Book of Mormon
            could not have been written before 1611, as it contains too many phrases, expressions, and entire passages
            directly lifted from the King James Bible.
            <br><br>
            Whether we’re discussing the original 1611 version of the KJV or the 1769 version, which many believe Joseph
            Smith used, the problem remains: the Book of Mormon is not an ancient text. Apologists may argue that it is
            a mix of a 19th-century text with an ancient source, but they must then demonstrate where that independent
            ancient source exists because the literary reliance on the King James Bible is pervasive throughout the
            text.
            <br><br>
            I will now highlight a few of the most prominent anachronisms in the Book of Mormon to further illustrate
            why this issue is unavoidable and how it reveals that the author did not fully understand the text from
            which he was drawing.
        </p>

        <h3>Deutero-Isaiah</h3>

        <p>
            This topic is explored in much greater detail in our <!--Needs referecing-->overview of Deutero-Isaiah, but
            it’s worth mentioning
            here because it is critically important. Most scholars now agree that the Book of Isaiah was written by
            three different authors, and we explain the reasons for this in our overview.
            <br><br>
            Chapters 40–55 of Isaiah, attributed to “Deutero-Isaiah,” were written after Lehi would have left with the
            plates. This means that none of the material from these chapters should appear in the Book of Mormon. Yet,
            not only is Isaiah 52 quoted in the Book of Mormon, but its themes are revisited multiple times throughout
            the text.
            <br><br>
            This is a major issue if the Book of Mormon is truly the ancient text it claims to be. The problem lies in
            the fact that the author of the Book of Mormon was unaware of the multiple authorship of Isaiah, which led
            to this significant oversight, leaving clear evidence of modern influence.
        </p>

        <h3>Anachronistic New Testament Material in the Book of Mormon</h3>

        <p>
            As covered in our <!--Needs referecing-->King James Bible Overview, the inclusion of New Testament material
            in the Book of Mormon
            presents a significant anachronism. The prophets in the Book of Mormon would not have had access to these
            writings, and the apologetic claim that they were revealed by God doesn’t hold up under scrutiny.
            <br><br>
            <em>The Sermon on the Mount</em> is a prime example of this issue. The Book of Mormon includes the Sermon on
            the
            Mount within its <em>Sermon at the Temple</em>, despite the fact that the New Testament had not yet been
            written at
            the time the Book of Mormon claims to have been compiled. While the author made minor adjustments (such as
            replacing “farthing” with the Nephite monetary system), key elements were left unchanged—like the Roman law
            of going an extra mile or the Aramaic term “Raca”—which would have made no sense in the Nephite context.
            This suggests a lack of awareness of the historical and cultural differences between the New Testament world
            and the purported Nephite civilization.
            <br><br>
            Additionally, scholars agree that the <em>Sermon on the Mount</em> and <em>Sermon on the Plain</em> were
            likely drawn
            from the
            same source of Jesus’ sayings, referred to as the “Q” source. These sayings were later woven into different
            sermons by Matthew and Luke, rather than being delivered as a single, continuous sermon. Thus, not only is
            this material anachronistic for the Nephites, but it also reflects a misunderstanding of how the New
            Testament writings themselves were constructed.
            <br><br>
            Moreover, the <em>Sermon on the Mount</em> as it appears in the Book of Mormon was clearly copied from the
            King James
            Version, with changes only where absolutely necessary to fit the Nephite setting. Many details were left
            unchanged, despite being incompatible with the ancient Nephite culture. This is another clear indication
            that the Book of Mormon relies heavily on existing, modern texts like the King James Bible.
            <br><br>
            In short, the inclusion of New Testament material—particularly the <em>Sermon on the Mount</em>—is a
            significant
            issue for the Book of Mormon’s authenticity. If Joseph Smith was dictating the Book of Mormon in a form of
            language acceptable as scripture (King James language), it still doesn’t explain why these anachronistic
            elements, along with their errors and historical inconsistencies, were included.
            <br><br>
            This is yet another instance where the author of the Book of Mormon relied on pre-existing texts, further
            demonstrating the text’s dependence on the King James Bible. For a deeper understanding of these issues, we
            highly recommend reading our detailed <em>Sermon on the Mount</em> Overview.
        </p>

        <h3>Long Ending of Mark</h3>

        <img src="images/anachronisms-1.webp" alt="mark 16" class="image-style-medium">

        <p>
            Just as we discussed with the Sermon on the Mount, scholars have found that the earliest manuscripts of the
            Gospel of Mark did not include the “long ending” found in the King James Bible. Many modern Bible
            translations even note that this extended ending was added long after the original manuscript was written by
            the author of Mark.
            <br><br>
            However, material from this “Long Ending of Mark” still appears in the Book of Mormon.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            Mark 16:17-18 (KJV): "17 And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out
            devils; they shall speak with new tongues;
            <br><br>
            18 They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay
            hands on the sick, and they shall recover."
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Now compare this to the Book of Mormon:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            Mormon 9:24: "And these signs shall follow them that believe—in my name shall they cast out devils; they
            shall speak with new tongues; they shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not
            hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover."
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Again, you can read the longer overview on the “Long Ending of Mark,” but the problem is the same as above.
            Joseph Smith did not realize the ending was not original to Mark as he was writing the Book of Mormon, which
            is why material was pulled from it.
        </p>

        <h3>The use of Messiah and Christ in the Book of Mormon</h3>

        <p>
            This is an area we have not previously covered, but it runs into the same problems that we outlined above
            with Deutero-Isaiah. Joseph Smith did not appear to realize that Messiah and Christ are the same word with
            different translations.
            <br><br>
            From Brent Metcalfe’s book New Approaches to the Book of Mormon:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “The Book of Mormon’s use of the term “Christ” is a perplexing feature of the book. Biblical scholars concur
            that the Aramaic meshiha’ (Heb. mashiah; Eng. Messiah) and its Greek translation Christos (Eng. Christ) both
            mean “Anointed.” They further agree that “Christ” became a proper name along with “Jesus” only after
            non-Semites, who did not have a Hebrew conception of the title, were converted and an essentially Judaic
            Christianity began to be hellenized (DeJonge 1992; Fitzmeyer 1982, 85-87; Kittel and Friedrich 1964-76,
            9:527-80; Perkins 1985; cf. Robinson 1992, 740; Welch 1992b, 749). In contrast, Book of Mormon Hebrews do
            not use the terms “Christ” and “Messiah” synonymously. Rather they employ the term “Christ” most frequently
            as a type of messianic surname…
            <br><br>
            "Christ” as a proper name poses linguistic problems that challenged early defenders of the Book of Mormon.
            Oliver Cowdery chided a critic who raised the issue as being “ignorant presumptuous and incompetent to
            handle the matter he has undertaken.” Cowdery argued that “[t]he words Jesus and Christ … are radically
            neither English nor Greek, for both have Hebrew roots” (Messenger and Advocate 3 [Oct. 1836]: 398). This
            remains apologists’ chief line of defense (see Brown 1984, 35; McConkie and Millet 1987, 265-66; Nibley
            1988b, 167-68; Ricks 1984, 25; Welch 1992c, 228, 241n6; cf. McConkie 1988, 75-76).
            <br><br>
            Yet the Book of Mormon does not accommodate this apologetic since it insists at many points on a clear
            distinction between “Messiah” and “Christ.”38 The Book of Mormon ostensibly defines “Messiah” as “savior” or
            “redeemer” (1 Ne. 10:4-5, 1:19; 2 Ne. 1:10, 2:6). “Christ,” coupled with the term “Jesus,” becomes the
            Messiah’s name (e.g., 2 Ne. 10:3; 25:16, 19; Mosiah 3:8; 5:8).39 Because of this semantic [p.429]
            distinction, Nephi can prophesy that Jews at the end of time “shall believe in Christ, and worship the
            Father in his name … and look not forward any more for another Messiah” (2 Ne. 25:16). And he can also
            proclaim, “[T]he Messiah cometh … [and] his name shall be Jesus Christ” (v. 19). “Christ” is even juxtaposed
            with other proper names such as “Nephi” and “Moses.”40” (<a
                href="https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1201&context=msr/">Metcalfe, New
                Approaches to the Book of Mormon</a>)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Effectively this presents a few problems for the Book of Mormon. First, they are using the name Christ 600
            years before Christ’s arrival, which is anachronistic on the surface. The apologetic response to this is
            that the name Christ was given via revelation so it would therefore not be an anachronism, but again this
            does not make sense given that the Bible makes no such mention of Jesus Christ’s arrival.
            <br><br>
            Second, this shows that the author of the Book of Mormon did not understand the linguistics behind Messiah
            and Christ, and this leads to a very clear problem. In 2 Nephi we have the following:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “19 For according to the words of the prophets, the Messiah cometh in six hundred years from the time that
            my father left Jerusalem; and according to the words of the prophets, and also the word of the angel of God,
            his name shall be Jesus Christ, the Son of God.”
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Because Messiah and Christ have the same meaning but under a different translation, what Joseph Smith has
            done here is the modern day equivalent of saying something like this:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “We will know that the sign of a good life is to be next to a dog [English word]. I have been told by an
            angel that the dog will be known as Perra [Spanish translation of dog].”
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This is a pretty clear indicator that this not an ancient text that is a literal history, because the author
            is clearly unaware that he is using the Greek translation of “anointed” when introducing what he believes is
            the name “Christ.”
            <br><br>
            Furthermore, Joseph Smith makes this claim in the Times and Seasons in 1843:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “There was no Greek or Latin upon the plates from which I, through the grace of God, translated the Book of
            Mormon. Let the language of that book speak for itself.” (Times and Seasons, Nauvoo, Illinois, vol. 4
            (1843), p. 194)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            If there was no Greek upon the plates, there could be no Christ on the plates. This is a problem with Joseph
            Smith not understanding the linguistics as he produced the Book of Mormon, and we see this same problem in
            the Book of Abraham when Joseph Smith incorrectly translates Facsimile 3. From Egyptologist Dr. Robert
            Ritner:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “In Facsimile 3, Smith confuses human and animal heads and males with females. No amount of special pleading
            can change the female “Isis the great, the god’s mother” (Facsimile 3, Fig. 2) into the male “King Pharaoh,
            whose name is given in the characters above his hand,” as even the LDS author Michael D. Rhodes accepts.
            <strong>Here Smith also misunderstands “Pharaoh” as a personal name rather than a title meaning “king,” so
                he reads
                “king king” for a goddess’s name that he claims to have understood on the papyrus!</strong>” (<a
                href="https://oi.uchicago.edu/sites/oi.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/shared/Translation%20and%20Historicity%20of%20the%20Book%20of%20Abraham_Revised.pdf">Ritner,

                and Historicity of the Book of Abraham” - A Response</a>)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            As if that is not enough, this also occurs in the Kirtland Temple when Joseph Smith claims to see both Elias
            and Elijah during the same vision. What Joseph Smith does not realize is that Elijah is the Hebrew
            translation and Elias is the Greek translation. In other words, this is another instance where Joseph Smith
            mistakes a different translation for a separate being, which again shows us that the Book of Mormon is not
            an ancient record and that Joseph Smith was not a prophet of God. (<a

        </p>

        <h3>The Idea and Historicity of the Brass Plates</h3>

        <p>
            In the gold plates overview I covered that the idea of metal plates with long writings is simply
            anachronistic. There are no records or plates that the church can provide that show ancient writings on
            metal plates that are of any considerable length.
        </p>

        <figure>

        </figure>
        <figcaption>The Pyrgi Tablets, sheets of gold with a bilingual treatise in Etruscan and Phoenician</figcaption>

        <p>
            To recap from that section, we covered the Pyrgi Tablets (shown above), which apologists cite as proof of
            ancient writing on metal. You can read about them on Wikipedia, and take a look at how little text is on
            those three plates. If anything, the Pyrgi Tablets show how implausible the Book of Mormon is when you take
            a step back and think of the implications.
            <br><br>
            The Pyrgi tablets only contain about 200 words on the three plates/tables above. If you look at the images,
            you can see that the tablets/plates are packed with characters. Now understand that those three plates would
            need to have about 66,000 words for the math to work with the gold plates of the Book of Mormon.
            <br><br>
            This is a problem because the Book of Mormon includes the story of the brass plates, which were taken from
            Laban after Nephi killed him. These plates included very lengthy and detailed records. From the January 1988
            Ensign:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “Although the information is sparse concerning the origin of the plates of brass, the Book of Mormon is
            quite detailed on what the plates contained. According to Nephi, the plates of brass contained the books of
            Moses and the Mosaic law (see 1 Ne. 4:15–16; 1 Ne. 5:11), tying the Nephites to their Old World kinsmen in
            both cultural practice and belief. They contained, in addition, a listing of Lehi’s fathers back through
            Joseph of old (see 1 Ne. 5:14), linking the Lehite colony genealogically with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
            thereby perpetuating the patriarchal covenant—“the promises made to the fathers” (D&C 2:2; JS—H 1:39)—in a
            new hemisphere. Finally, the plates contained a more extensive account of Old Testament peoples and events
            than the Bible (see 1 Ne. 5:12–13; 1 Ne. 13:23), although only a few precious remnants of this account are
            found in the Book of Mormon.” (<a

        </blockquote>

        <p>
            The problems here are numerous, but I want to highlight how anachronistic this story is in the Book of
            Mormon.
            <br><br>
            Most scholars today conclude that the Pentateuch was not written until the 6th century or, more likely, 5th
            century BCE. This means that when Lehi left in 587 BCE, these five books (outside of Deuteronomy) were
            likely not even written at this point. (Davies, G.I, "Introduction to the Pentateuch")
            <br><br>
            What this means is that if Lehi left with records, they would not resemble the Pentateuch that is used by
            Joseph Smith in the Book of Mormon. Unfortunately for the Book of Mormon, the problems do not end here.
            <br><br>
            Beyond the text almost certainly not being written before Lehi left, the idea of a “codex” was not even
            practiced until the 4th century CE. Until this time the books of the Bible would have been on separate
            scrolls, which might have been kept together by religious leaders, but would not have been bound together.
            In other words, even if you believe Lehi had the ‘Five Books of Moses’ against the evidence that they had
            not been compiled yet, there is no way they would’ve been put together in a codex format. (<a
                href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/codex-manuscript">Britannica</a>)
            <br><br>
            Now even if we concede that the ‘Five Books of Moses’ were compile before Lehi left in 587 BC against the
            current consensus, and then even if we accept the idea that they were using a codex style of binding them
            together almost a thousand years before we have any record of that occurring, there is still the problem of
            language.
            <br><br>
            We are told that the brass plates were written in Egyptian, which is another problem for the Book of Mormon.
            Scholars can tell that the ‘Five Books of Moses’ were “originally written almost entirely in Hebrew, with a
            few short elements in Aramaic.” (<a
                href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/biblical-translation">Britannica</a>)
            <br><br>
            This means that for the Book of Mormon’s narrative to be true, we would need the ‘Five Books of Moses’ to be
            compiled before Lehi left in 587 BCE, which is against the scholarly consensus that these books were being
            developed in the 6th and 5th centuries BCE. Then we would need these books to be translated to Egyptian,
            which goes against all evidence regarding the compilation of these books. After the translation, we would
            need them to be engraved on plates of brass, which again there is absolutely no evidence for and, as we will
            explain below, reasons to show this did not happen. After this translation into Egyptian and engraving on
            brass, we would finally need the five books to be compiled in a codex, which was not utilized until about a
            thousand years after Lehi left.
            <br><br>
            None of these four problems (compilation of the books, Egyptian language translation, engraved onto plates
            of brass, and codex format) are historically backed, which makes the idea that all four could’ve happened
            simultaneously impossible.
            <br><br>
            With regards to engraving these books on the plates, we also run into the same problems here that we did
            with the Book of Mormon, which is that the math is going to be a problem. The ‘Five Books of Moses’ alone
            contain 156,916 words, and that doesn’t even get into the vast material that are claimed to be on the brass
            plates beyond those five books.
            <br><br>
            There is no mention of “Reformed Egyptian” in the Old World, which means that these engravings would likely
            be in demotic Egyptian. As Egyptologist Dr. Robert Ritner explained, demotic Egyptian is a phonetic
            language, meaning that the amount of brass plates needed to engrave the ‘Five Books of Moses’ would be
            incredibly large.
            <br><br>
            Remember that those three Pyrgi plates above hold just about 200 words. The ‘Five Books of Moses’ alone
            contain over 156,000 words in English. That would imply that you’re looking at almost 800 plates needed just
            for the five books alone before getting into the rest of the material that were included in the plates that
            was mentioned in the Ensign quote above.
            <br><br>
            Just imagine having 800 brass plates that you’re carrying around with records. It just becomes absurd when
            you really break down this issue and look at how each layer creates another problem that is further
            compounded by the next. Even if we agree that the language could possibly allow for half the characters,
            you're still stealing a 400 plate collection at minimum.
            <br><br>
            The idea of plates was written into the Book of Mormon for two reasons: The first reason being that Joseph
            Smith claimed to have uncovered gold plates, so this allows the plates to have more weight as a method of
            record keeping by the inhabitants of ancient America. The season reason is that it made sense that you would
            need records to be on metal or stone in order to survive for so long in the ground, but it unfortunately is
            still incredibly anachronistic given not just what we have as examples of ancient writing on metal, but
            Joseph Smith’s indication that they were written in Egyptian before Lehi left.
        </p>

        <h3>Steel</h3>

        <p>
            The idea of steel is anachronistic to the Book of Mormon, and there’s really no way around it. From the Book
            of Mormon:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            2 Nephi 5:15: “And I did teach my people to build buildings, and to work in all manner of wood, and of iron,
            and of copper, and of brass, and of steel, and of gold, and of silver, and of precious ores, which were in
            great abundance.”
            <br><br>
            Ether 7:9: “Wherefore, he came to the hill Ephraim, and he did molten out of the hill, and made swords out
            of steel for those whom he had drawn away with him; and after he had armed them with swords he returned to
            the city Nehor, and gave battle unto his brother Corihor, by which means he obtained the kingdom and
            restored it unto his father Kib.”
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Creating steel necessitates a lot of resources that leaves a footprint behind, which is why we can be sure
            that there was no steel production in Book of Mormon times. When steel is produced to create weaponry, there
            is slag left behind along with remnants of steel weaponry along with the sites that would be used to create
            these weapons.
            <br><br>
            The Smithsonian puts it in even more clear terms:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “5. Iron, steel, glass, and silk were not used in the New World before 1492 (except for occasional use of
            unsmelted meteoric iron). Native copper was worked in various locations in pre-Columbian times, but true
            metallurgy was limited to southern Mexico and the Andean region, where its occurrence in late prehistoric
            times involved gold, silver, copper, and their alloys, but not iron.” (<a
                href="www.lightplanet.com/response/Smithsonian-letter.htm">Smithsonian Letter</a>)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Furthermore, the advantages that could be gained by having steel production are massive, and would not
            simply go away. This has led apologists to suggest that steel doesn’t mean “steel,” which is what FAIR
            Mormon replies to the Letter For My Wife with:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “The author assumes that "steel" refers to modern steel, which did not exist in pre-Columbian America. Steel
            has been found in the Old World in the appropriate time period.” (<a
                href="https://www.fairlatterdaysaints.org/answers/Criticism_of_Mormonism/Online_documents/For_my_Wife_and_Children_(Letter_to_my_Wife)/Chapter_13#Response_to_claim:_.22The_Book_of_Mormon_time_period_covers_2.2C200_B.C._.E2.80.93_400_A.D..2C_and_also_contains_similar_anachronisms...Metal_Working.22">FAIR
                Mormon</a>)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            They further explain how this is not an anachronism in the following way:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “The steel of the Book of Mormon is probably not modern steel. Steel, as we understand today, had to be
            produced using a very cumbersome process and was extremely expensive until the development of puddling
            towards the end of the 18th century. Even in ancient times, however, experienced smiths could produce steel
            by heating and hammering pig-iron or, earlier still, the never-molten iron from a bloomery to loose the
            surplus of carbon to get something like elastic steel. Early smiths even knew that by quenching hot steel in
            water, oil, or a salt solution the surface could be hardened.
            <br><br>
            Any Mesoamerican production likely depended upon the first method, which requires lower temperatures and
            less sophistication. Laban's "steel sword" is not anachronistic; Middle Eastern smiths were making steel by
            the tenth century B.C.” (<a
                href="https://www.fairlatterdaysaints.org/answers/Criticism_of_Mormonism/Online_documents/For_my_Wife_and_Children_(Letter_to_my_Wife)/Chapter_13#Response_to_claim:_.22The_Book_of_Mormon_time_period_covers_2.2C200_B.C._.E2.80.93_400_A.D..2C_and_also_contains_similar_anachronisms...Metal_Working.22">FAIR
                Mormon</a>)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Anachronisms are elements that are out of time and place, which means that evidence of steel being made in
            the Middle East in the tenth century does not solve the problem in the Americas. This is an apologetic trick
            to try and focus in on a detail to ignore the problem at hand, but having evidence in the Middle East does
            not tell you anything about the Americas, which they cite because they know the Americans simply did not
            have this technology during Book of Mormon times.
            <br><br>
            FAIR then cites apologist William Hamblin’s contention that steel is not anachronistic because it is not
            specifically mentioned in the Book of Mormon after 400 BCE. Their conclusion is that “Significantly, there
            are no references to Nephite steel after 400 B.C.”
            <br><br>
            Again, steel is not a problem if the events of the Book of Mormon took place in the Middle East where there
            is evidence of early work with steel, but the events described in the Book of Mormon happen in the Americas.
            Furthermore, the verses quotes above both take place in the Americas, which makes Hamblin’s assertion a
            deflection rather than an answer.
            <br><br>
            In other words, evidence of steel being produced in the Middle East does not help the Book of Mormon’s
            problem, but instead shows us that Joseph Smith is pulling ideas from his milieu when dictating the story,
            which unfortunately did not yet understand that steel was not being made in the Americas for weaponry until
            long after the Book of Mormon times.
        </p>

        <h3>Wheat and Barley</h3>

        <p>
            The idea of wheat and barley being available in the Americas during Book of Mormon times is certainly
            anachronistic, and I will cite this (church friendly) Maxwell Institute summary to outline the issue:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “Of the more than twenty-eight references to grain in the Book of Mormon, barley is mentioned four times
            (Mosiah 7:22; 9:9; Alma 11:7, 15) and wheat once (Mosiah 9:9). These references to barley and wheat in an
            ancient American record have puzzled some readers because it is generally assumed that domesticated barley
            and wheat were introduced to the New World by Europeans after 1492.
            <br><br>
            Research on this matter supports two possible explanations. First, the terms barley and wheat, as used in
            the Book of Mormon, may refer to certain other New World crop plants that were given Old World designations;
            and second, the terms may refer to genuine varieties of New World barley and wheat.” (<a
                href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070223121554/http://farms.byu.edu/display.php?table=transcripts&id=126">Bennett,
                Barley and
                Wheat in the Book of Mormon</a>)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            The first thing I want to note is that again here we are being told that barley and wheat don’t actually
            mean “barley” and “wheat.” This is again loan shifting words in order to make sense of the problems that
            Joseph Smith created by including them. Again, this becomes a problem that is compounded by the translation
            process which we will cover in our next overview, but the moment you’re telling us that words don’t mean
            what they mean at face value, it’s a problem.
            <br><br>
            Dr. Michael Coe, who was the Charles J. MacCurdy professor emeritus of Anthropology at Yale University and
            curator emeritus of the Division of Anthropology at the school’s Peabody Museum of Natural History, made
            clear that if there were wheat and barley in the Americas during Book of Mormon times, we would know it
            through our studies of soil cores.
            <br><br>
            During his <a
                href="https://www.mormonstories.org/mormon/michael-coe-an-outsiders-view-of-book-of-mormon-archaeology/">Mormon
                Stories interview</a>, Coe explained how these plants leave pollen that can be found during
            archaeological digs, which is how we have so much information on what plants were indigenous to the Americas
            and which ones were brought over.
            <br><br>
            The following is a great illustration of just how important pollen is to understanding the history of
            agriculture in an area:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “An example of the type of research that shows Book of Mormon agriculture to be nineteenth century fantasy
            is David J. Rue's 1987 paper in Nature titled "Early Agriculture and Early Postclassic Maya Occupation in
            Western Honduras." By studying soil corings from Lake Yojoa and Petapida Swamp, both in western Honduras,
            Rue was able to reconstruct the agricultural history of the area from a time 4770 years before the present
            up to modem times. He could tell from pollen when the region was forested, when the forest was cut and
            burned for agriculture, what crops were grown and for how long. Although he found clear records of pollen
            from corn (maize) and amaranth - two Amerindian staples - he makes no mention of wheat, barley, or flax
            pollen.” (<a href="http://nowscape.com/mormon/zindler1.htm">Zindler, How Do You Lose a Steel Mill</a>)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Furthermore, this kind of study can also show us where plants came from, which is important when it comes to
            Barley. From Zindler:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “What does archaeology tell us of the presence or absence of the crops Smith claimed were the staples of
            ancient America? No remains of wheat or domesticated barley have ever been found. In fact, the one possible
            pre-Columbian specimen of barley discovered at a site in Arizona [not a Book of Mormon location anyway per
            apologists] is of a species different from the species of domesticated barley allegedly brought from the
            Near East.” (<a href="http://nowscape.com/mormon/zindler1.htm">Zindler, How Do You Lose a Steel Mill</a>)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            In other words, the lone example of barley in the Americas that apologists cite as proof for the Book of
            Mormon can be identified as a separate specimen from the barley that was domesticated in the Near East,
            which negates any credibility to it being evidence for the Book of Mormon.
            <br><br>
            If you’ve never listened to Dr. Coe’s Mormon Stories interviews, I highly recommend them because they go
            well beyond wheat and barley and cover the idea of horses, chariots, wheels, silk, and so many more
            anachronisms for the Book of Mormon. (<a
                href="https://www.mormonstories.org/faith-crisis-stories/dr-michael-coe/">2011 Interviews, 2018

        </p>

        <h3>King Zedekiah</h3>

        <p>
            This issue is one I don’t see covered too often, but is important because it shows that the author of the
            Book of Mormon erred in the chronology of events leading up to the departure of Lehi.
            <br><br>
            From 1 Nephi:4:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “For it came to pass in the commencement of the first year of the reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah, (my
            father, Lehi, having dwelt at Jerusalem in all his days); and in that same year there came many prophets,
            prophesying unto the people that they must repent, or the great city Jerusalem must be destroyed.”
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            The problem here is that Nephi says this happened <em>during</em> the first year of Zedekiah, but Zedekiah
            was only
            put in after Nebuchadnezzar II, king of Babylon, sieged Jerusalem and made him king.
            <br><br>
            In other words, the first year of Zedekiah was the first year of the Babylonian exile, meaning that the city
            was already devastated and thousands had been taken captive and their property pillaged. To be clear, the
            Book of Mormon has Lehi making a prophecy for something that had already happened.
            <br><br>
            This problem is further complicated by the Book of Mormon stating that Lehi lived in Jerusalem his entire
            life, which means that he could not have been unaware that Jerusalem was already taken over and devastated
            before making this prophecy. If the Book of Mormon was a true historical record, Lehi would have already
            lived through the besieging in 605 BCE along with the siege of 599-597 BCE that led to Zedekiah being
            installed as king.
            <br><br>
            Furthermore, Lehi’s sons do not believe Lehi’s prophecy that Jerusalem could be destroyed. From 1 Nephi
            2:13:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “Neither did they believe that Jerusalem, that great city, could be destroyed according to the words of the
            prophets. And they were like unto the Jews who were at Jerusalem, who sought to take away the life of my
            father.”
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Again, this makes absolutely no sense given that Jerusalem has already been devastated, many thousands of
            leaders and ruling class people had been taken captive, and the city and temple pillaged. The chronology is
            off, and this timeframe is crucial in that it’s where most scholars agree the Bible becomes more reliably
            historical beginning with the reign of Zedekiah.
            <br><br>
            The timing is also problematic in that Lehi is portrayed as a prominent figure in Jerusalem, descending from
            the line of Joseph. When Jerusalem was sieged, they took over 10,000 of its citizens to Babylon, and yet
            Lehi was left in Jerusalem. This is also true of Laban, who is given importance in the text, yet he also
            remains behind with brass plates that would have also been of great wealth to Babylon if they existed.
            <br><br>
            As I mentioned above, this is where scholars can identify these events as historical because there are
            corroborating materials. In this case, the sieges and captures are recorded in both the Bible and Babylonian
            records, yet are completely absent from the Book of Mormon.
            <br><br>
            While on the surface it might seem like a small issue, the fact that the opening chapter of the Book of
            Mormon are out of the correct timeframe is a big problem for any claim to being a historical record. (On a
            small side note, this is exactly what happens in the very beginning of the Book of Abraham as well.) There
            is absolutely no way that Lehi could live in Jerusalem all his days and not know that Jerusalem had been
            taken over, let alone have children that did not believe it could happen.
            <br><br>
            As we’ve pointed out in these overviews, these are the seemingly tiny mistakes that let us know that a text
            is not what it claims to be. In the case of the Book of Mormon, throughout these overviews we have provided
            example after example where we can show that not only can the Book of Mormon not be an ancient text, but
            that the author has to be Joseph Smith.
        </p>

        <h3>A Developed Christology Before Christ</h3>

        <p>
            As we’ve pointed out already throughout these sections, the Book of Mormon features a Christology that was
            not developed historically until after Jesus’ life, hundreds of years before Jesus even arrives.

            The Book of Mormon includes being baptized in the name of Christ over 150 years before Jesus would be
            baptized. From Mosiah 18:13:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “And when he had said these words, the Spirit of the Lord was upon him, and he said: Helam, I baptize thee,
            having authority from the Almighty God, as a testimony that ye have entered into a covenant to serve him
            until you are dead as to the mortal body; and may the Spirit of the Lord be poured out upon you; and may he
            grant unto you eternal life, through the redemption of Christ, whom he has prepared from the foundation of
            the world.”
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Even more to the point, the Book of Mormon states early on the need to baptized in Jesus’ name in 2 Nephi.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            2 Nephi 31:5,12: “And now, if the Lamb of God, he being holy, should have need to be baptized by water, to
            fulfil all righteousness, O then, how much more need have we, being unholy, to be baptized, yea, even by
            water! …And also, the voice of the Son came unto me, saying: He that is baptized in my name, to him will the
            Father give the Holy Ghost, like unto me; wherefore, follow me, and do the things which ye have seen me do.”
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            While I understand the apologetic argument is that they received the concept of baptism through revelation,
            the Book of Mormon people are being baptized in Christ’s name before Christ even dies and before the
            atonement of Jesus Christ.
            <br><br>
            Furthermore, Nephi is rewriting Isaiah to make Isaiah 48 about baptism, which is a problem not just because
            it’s reinterpreting Isaiah to fit the Book of Mormon, but because Isaiah 48 is part of the Deutero-Isaiah
            text that was not written before Lehi left with the brass plates.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            1 Nephi 20:1 “Hearken and hear this, O house of Jacob, who are called by the name of Israel, and are come
            forth out of the waters of Judah, or out of the waters of baptism, who swear by the name of the Lord, and
            make mention of the God of Israel, yet they swear not in truth nor in righteousness.”
            <br><br>
            Isaiah 48:1 “Hear ye this, O house of Jacob, which are called by the name of Israel, and are come forth out
            of the waters of Judah, which swear by the name of the LORD, and make mention of the God of Israel, but not
            in truth, nor in righteousness.”
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Much as I highlighted about the Charles Anthon visit, biblical scholars do not believe that Isaiah was
            speaking about baptism in this verse, and you can read an <a
                href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/isaiah/48-1.htm">assortment of commentaries on this verse at
                Bible
                Hub</a>. This is another instance where Joseph Smith changes a writing of Isaiah to fit the Book of
            Mormon
            narrative in a way that has not only not been confirmed by scholarship, but refuted.
            <br><br>
            Apologists tend to point to the Mikveh (Jewish font for the tevilah, which is a ritual cleansing by
            immersion) as proof of pre-Christian baptism, but again that is not the same practice and apologists know
            this. From a great <a
                href="https://lecturesondoubt.com/2016/09/15/pre-christian-baptisms-and-why-it-was-an-early-shelf-item-for-me/">article</a>
            on pre-Christian baptism in the Book of Mormon, here are some of the reasons that
            the tevilah, that is, the Jewish immersion ritual, is done:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>For converts to Judaism. As far as I can tell, if you were born “in the covenant,” you do not have this
                ceremony done. To my knowledge, there is, and never has been, a Jewish custom of baptizing their youth
                when they reach 8 years old. It’s strictly for Gentiles.</li>
            <li>For men, after they ejaculate</li>
            <li>For women, after their period is over.</li>
            <li>For anyone who has had abnormal bodily discharges.</li>
            <li>For people with certain skin conditions</li>
            <li>For people that have come in contact with the aforementioned unclean people.</li>
            <li>For someone who is being consecrated to the Aaronic Priesthood.</li>
            <li>For the Priest who sends away the scapegoat</li>
            <li>For someone who’s touched a corpse or a grave</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            This is certainly nothing like the concept of Christian baptisms occurring centuries before the atonement of
            Jesus Christ, which makes the inclusion of it in the Book of Mormon problematic. From the aforementioned
            article:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “Now I should note that I’ve simplified a complex subject in making this list; the tevilah is not observed
            the same way among all branches of Judaism, and I described the list of reasons tersely, at the expense of
            precision. But these requirements come from the Torah (aka, the first five books of the Bible) and the
            Talmud. They faithfully represent the purpose of the tevilah in Rabbinical Judaism. When you take a step
            back, you quickly recognize that the tevilah is really not that much like the ordinance of baptism. There
            are some physical similarities, but it is clearly not the “gate” that you must enter described by Nephi.
            It’s clearly not a covenant between you and God that sets you on your life’s journey and absolves you of
            your sins. It’s part of the ritual washing and purification tenets of the Judaic law. There’s no laying on
            of hands for the Gift of the Holy Ghost afterwards. And of course – do I have to say it? – the tevilah is
            decidedly not done in the name of Jesus Christ.” (<a
                href="https://lecturesondoubt.com/2016/09/15/pre-christian-baptisms-and-why-it-was-an-early-shelf-item-for-me/">Pre-Christian
                Baptisms and Why It Was an Early Shelf Item for Me</a>)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Again, apologists would argue that John the Baptist was performing baptisms before Christ, which means that
            the revelation from God could have occurred before Christ’s arrival. But that misses the point when we have
            Book of Mormon people doing it hundreds of years before Christ.
            <br><br>
            Another important point is that many biblical scholars contend that John the Baptist was an apocalyptical
            preacher and believed the end of the world was imminent. From New Testament scholar Dr. Bart Ehrman:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “And why is that significant [Jesus being a follower of John the Baptist] for understanding Jesus as an
            apocalypticist? Because of what John stood for. We get the clearest expression of John’s views in our
            earliest account of his preaching, in Q. Here John is shown to be a proclaimer of imminent apocalyptic
            destruction. As he says, in urging people to repent: “The axe is already laid at the root of the tree; every
            tree that does not bear good fruit will be cut down and cast into the fire” (see Luke 3:9).
            <br><br>
            This is an apocalyptic image of coming destruction. People who do not live worthily of God by “bearing good
            fruit” will be cut down and destroyed by fire. And when will that happen? The axe is already laid to the
            root of the tree – in other words, the chopping is now ready to begin. Judgment is here and will soon take
            place.” (<a href="https://ehrmanblog.org/the-baptism-of-jesus-as-an-apocalyptic-event/">Ehrman, The Baptism
                of Jesus as a Apocalyptic Event</a>)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            To be clear, John the Baptist was Jewish, and he would have almost certainly been performing the cleansing
            ritual of the tevilah to make sure people were clean before the end times. It is difficult to then use this
            as evidence of pre-Christian baptisms such as the fully developed Christian baptisms in the Book of Mormon.
        </p>

        <h3>What You Would Expect in the Book of Mormon</h3>

        <p>
            Now that I’ve covered a few examples of anachronisms in the Book of Mormon, I want to highlight very quickly
            some important items and concepts that should be in the Book of Mormon if it was a literal history of the
            ancient Americas.
        </p>

        <h4>Jewish Traditions</h4>

        <p>
            First, as I just mentioned above, the Book of Mormon has a Christology hundreds of years before Jesus Christ
            lives, which is problematic on its own. But what is even more telling about the Book of Mormon is that these
            are Jewish people who leave Jerasulem – not Christians – and yet they do not mention the most important
            Jewish customs in the Book of Mormon.
            <br><br>
            The Book of Mormon mentions the ‘Law of Moses’ multiple times throughout the text (2 Ne. 25:24–30; Mosiah
            12:27–13:32; 3 Ne. 9:17; 15:1–8), yet nowhere in the Book of Mormon are Jewish traditions actually present.
            There are no mentions of important dates such as Passover, no mentions of the practice of circumcision,
            observing the Sabbath, or religious rites such as burnt offerings.
            <br><br>
            I don’t want to get into the geography debate here, but many scholars point to the Mesoamerican model as
            where the Book of Mormon took place, but anachronisms hinder the ability of Book of Mormon people to
            practice the Law of Moses in Mesoamerica.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “Mesoamerica did not have lambs, sheep, rams, bullocks, doves, wheat, barley or wine during the time of the
            Book of Mormon. These were all necessary animals and plants to practice the Law of Moses.
            <br><br>
            Not only this, but the proper seasons were required to practice the Law of Moses. In Mesoamerica there is
            very little change in seasons.” (<a
                href="https://bookofmormonevidence.org/whats-wrong-with-the-mesoamerican-theory-seasons-migrating-domesticated-animals-the-law-of-moses/#Domesticated_Animals_in_Mesoamerica">What’s
                Wrong with the Mesoamerican Theory? Seasons, Migrating &
                Domesticated Animals, & the Law of Moses</a>)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Instead of the traditional Jewish practices, the Book of Mormon has already moved on to a form of
            Christianity that is much more representative of Joseph Smith’s time than it is of Old Testament times.
            While it might not seem as glaring when you read the Book of Mormon because it features Christian concepts
            so close to our time, it is problematic that the people in the Book of Mormon do not appear to celebrate the
            traditions that they came from.
        </p>

        <h4>Agriculture and Animals Indigenous to the Americas</h4>

        <p>
            As I mentioned above, I highly recommend Dr. Coe’s interviews because he was one of the top experts in the
            history of the Mayas and, since many apologists contend that the Book of Mormon took place in Mesoamerica,
            he is a great source on understanding not just what is anachronistic in the Book of Mormon, but what is
            missing as well.
            <br><br>
            Coe makes clear that there was no system of coinage among the Mayans, but that they used cocoa beans (or
            cacao beans) as a currency when bartering for goods. Yet there is no mention of cocoa beans in the Book of
            Mormon while there are 28 references to grains and references to some sort of monetary system.
            <br><br>
            Furthermore, the Book of Mormon mentions animals that are highly anachronistic to the Book of Mormon’s time
            such as horses, elephants, and domesticated livestock, but they neglect to mention animals that were
            indigenous to the ancient Americas such as wild turkeys.
        </p>

        <h3>Unique Doctrines of Mormonism</h3>

        <p>
            Finally, we are told as members that the Book of Mormon brings us the fullness of the Gospel. I hope in
            these overviews I have illustrated why this is problematic, given that so much of what is in the Book of
            Mormon is a rehash of the King James Bible, but it goes even deeper when you look at what is not in the Book
            of Mormon.
            <br><br>
            Below is a selection of key concepts in Mormonism that do not have any mention in the Book of Mormon:
        </p>

        <h4>Jesus and God the Father being separate beings, Godhood, and the Premortal Existence</h4>

        <p>
            Joseph Smith’s later theology is clear that Jesus and God the Father are separate beings, yet in the Book of
            Mormon we are given a very mainstream Christian view of the ‘trinity.’ Compare the following:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            D&C 130:22: “The Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man’s; the Son also; but the Holy Ghost
            has not a body of flesh and bones, but is a personage of Spirit. Were it not so, the Holy Ghost could not
            dwell in us.”
            <br><br>
            Mosiah 3:8: “And he shall be called Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Father of heaven and earth, the
            Creator of all things from the beginning; and his mother shall be called Mary.”
            <br><br>
            Ether 4:7: “7 …saith Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the eFather of the heavens and of the earth, and all
            things that in them are.”
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Ignoring that Mosiah not only foretells of Jesus, but of the specific name Mary as well, you can see clearly
            that the Book of Mormon does not teach that Jesus and God are separate beings just as the original First
            Vision accounts do not. This is significant, and we cover it in much more depth in our First Vision
            overview.
            <br><br>
            The Book of Mormon is also clear that there is only one God, which Joseph Smith will later contradict as he
            learns Hebrew and creates the Book of Abraham. From Alma 11:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “28 Now Zeezrom said: Is there more than one God?
            <br><br>
            29 And he answered, No.
            <br><br>
            30 Now Zeezrom said unto him again: How knowest thou these things?
            <br><br>
            31 And he said: An aangel hath made them known unto me.”
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This contradicts Joseph Smith’s later teachings that there are multiple Gods, which is compounded by the
            Book of Mormon being unaware of a premortal existence. There is simply no mention of this, nor is there a
            mention of God being the literal father of our spirits.
            <br><br>
            Last, we are taught as members of the church that God was once a man who progressed to Godhood, but the Book
            of Mormon tells us that God has not changed nor has ever changed. From the Book of Mormon:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            Mormon 9:9: “For do we not read that God is the same yesterday, today, and forever, and in him there is no
            variableness neither shadow of changing?”
            <br><br>
            Moroni 8:18: “For I know that God is not a partial God, neither a changeable being; but he is unchangeable
            from all eternity to all eternity.”
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Again, these are problematic issues when we look at how Joseph Smith changes and evolves the theology of the
            church following the Book of Mormon. It is easy to miss these details when reading the Book of Mormon, but
            sometimes what isn’t in the Book of Mormon is as telling as what is included.
        </p>

        <h3>Other Key Doctrines Not Mentioned in the Book of Mormon</h3>

        <p>
            There are many doctrines that are considered crucial to Mormonism that are simply not mentioned in the Book
            of Mormon. Among them:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Baptism for the dead</li>
            <li>A temple marriage being a requirement for exaltation</li>
            <li>Celestial marriage lasting for time and all eternity</li>
            <li>That salvation in the highest kingdom requires going through the endowment ceremony (in the Book of
                Mormon not only is there no mention of exaltation or an endowment ceremony, but the idea of “secret
                combinations” requiring secret oaths are condemned)</li>
            <li>Multiple priesthoods or the Melchizedek priesthood</li>
            <li>That the sacrament should include water</li>
            <li>The Word of Wisdom</li>
            <li>That prophets are promoted to the office by church leaders instead of God</li>
            <li>The Garden of Eden being in Missouri</li>
            <li>The idea of the “presidency” of the church is entirely anachronistic, and the Book of Mormon makes no
                such mention of anything beyond twelve disciples</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            This is just a brief list of key concepts that are completely absent in the Book of Mormon, and in future
            sections we are going to cover areas where the Book of Mormon is later contradicted by Joseph Smith
            including polygamy, the First Vision (separation of Jesus and God the Father), the two separate priesthoods,
            the temple ceremony, and the dark skin problem in the Book of Mormon.
            <br><br>
            For a longer list of concepts that were either not mentioned in the Book of Mormon or later contradicted by
            Joseph Smith (or Brigham Young), please check out Richard Packham’s write-up which I utilized for this
            selection above. (<a href="https://packham.n4m.org/bomvslds.htm">The Book of Mormon vs Mormonism,
                Packham</a>)
        </p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>

        <p>
            Throughout these Book of Mormon overview topics, I have attempted to show how completely reliant the Book of
            Mormon is not just on the King James Bible, but on the beliefs in Joseph Smith’s milieu.
            <br><br>
            I did not want to spend the section on anachronisms by simply listing the ones that are so commonly
            discussed, but to highlight where we can show that the Book of Mormon is a 19th century composition by
            looking at how Joseph Smith utilized the King James Bible. From there we can use scholarship to show where
            Joseph Smith made mistakes in the composition (Deutero-Isaiah, Sermon on the Mount, Long Ending of Mark, and
            the use of Christ and Messiah) to show that it cannot be an ancient text as the authors could not have
            accessed this material.
            <br><br>
            Furthermore, I wanted to highlight some of the key items and concepts that are not in the Book of Mormon,
            because that also helps us to understand that Joseph Smith did not understand what was ancient to the
            Americas, but instead relied on both the text of the Bible and what was around him to compose the Book of
            Mormon.
            <br><br>
            I tried to give some of the apologetics to these issues above, and in our biblical scholarship overviews I
            have covered them as well. This is a problem that we saw in the translation process, as apologists contend
            that translation doesn’t mean “translation,” because at the end of the day the Book of Mormon and Joseph
            Smith cannot withstand scrutiny if we take their claims at face value.
            <br><br>
            The moment that we propose changing the meanings of words, we can make literally anything possible, but then
            we also have to admit that we are going to run into a lot of problems with the translation process, which we
            will cover in the next section.
            When we look at what should be in the Book of Mormon but is not included, the apologetic response is that
            this is a living church that was being restored line by line. The problem is that not only does the Book of
            Mormon not include many of these key doctrines, but that in many areas the Book of Mormon directly
            contradicts them.
            <br><br>
            At the end of the day, if someone gives the Book of Mormon the same scrutiny they would give any other
            church, politician, or organization, they would immediately be able to point to the book being a modern
            creation. It simply does not fit in an ancient setting because it has too many modern themes, items, and
            beliefs, which then leaves apologists stating that it was an ancient text that was then filtered through
            Joseph Smith’s prophetic mind.
            <br><br>
            But that leaves us with more problems than answers, because the Book of Mormon contains so many errors that
            come from taking the Bible as a literal text (Adam and Eve, global flood, Tower of Babel), that we have to
            then ask why Joseph Smith is getting revelations that are riddled with errors. This is the same problem we
            run into with the Book of Abraham, and the church has moved from a literal translation off papyri to a
            “catalyst theory” following the ability to read Egyptian which makes clear that Joseph Smith got it
            completely wrong.
            <br><br>
            As I’ve said throughout these overviews, apologists want to take each problem in isolation to try and
            explain it away, but these issues are all very connected and need to be taken in totality. We see the exact
            same problems with the Book of Mormon that we do with the Book of Abraham, with the main difference being
            that we have the source material for the Book of Abraham where there is no source material for the Book of
            Mormon to compare to beyond the “Caractors” document, and that is already highly problematic as I’ve
            presented previously.
            <br><br>
            The problem is that once we take these issues in totality, there is no getting around the fact that the Book
            of Mormon is a 19th century text. This reality leads us to how apologists try to explain away these
            anachronisms, and in the next section, I want to give an overview of the “tight” and “loose” translation
            theories, looking at how apologists will shift between the two methods as needed, but why the Book of Mormon
            cannot be both loosely and tightly translated.
