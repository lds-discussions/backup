        <h2>Book of Mormon Overview: How It Was Composed</h2>

        <p>
            If you’ve been following the overview pages in order, you’ve now read fifteen overviews including eight
            specifically on the Book of Mormon and seven on biblical scholarship and Mormonism.
            <br><br>
            That’s a lot of different overviews and this is going to be the final one on the Book of Mormon, and in this
            one I want to take the information from the previous fifteen to explain how Joseph Smith could have authored
            the Book of Mormon.
            <br><br>
            As I began these overviews with Joseph Smith’s treasure digging, I had this quote from Prophet Ezra Taft
            Benson:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “The Book of Mormon is the keystone of our religion. This was the Prophet Joseph Smith’s statement. He
            testified that “the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our
            religion” (Introduction to the Book of Mormon). A keystone is the central stone in an arch. It holds all the
            other stones in place, and if removed, the arch crumbles.” (October 1986 General Conference)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This declaration from Benson is absolutely true, and I spent the last fifteen overviews explaining why that
            statement is so problematic for the church. The Book of Mormon is without question a 19th century production
            – this can be illustrated in many different ways as I have outlined, and is in no way an ancient, historical
            record.
            <br><br>
            Throughout the history of the church, many leaders have insisted that there is simply no way anyone could
            have produced the Book of Mormon without the power of God. I want to highlight a few quotes below to
            illustrate this point:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            <strong>Tad Callister, author of the book A Case For the Book of Mormon</strong>: “..the current argument
            being made is that Joseph Smith was a creative genius who read numerous books, such as “View of the Hebrews”
            and “The Late War Between the United States and Great Britain” and then copied ideas and stories from them.
            This, of course, is a total flip-flop, a 180-degree reversal from the original argument that Joseph was
            incapable, too ignorant to write such a book. Now, all of a sudden Joseph is a skilled, creative writer with
            genius intellect. Why the flip-flop? Because all the previous explanations for a man-made book had failed."
            (Elder Tad R. Callister: The Book of Mormon - man-made or God-given?)
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            <strong>Jeffrey R. Holland:</strong> “If anyone is foolish enough or misled enough to reject 531 pages of a
            heretofore
            unknown text teeming with literary and Semitic complexity without honestly attempting to account for the
            origin of those pages—especially without accounting for their powerful witness of Jesus Christ and the
            profound spiritual impact that witness has had on what is now tens of millions of readers—if that is the
            case, then such a person, elect or otherwise, has been deceived; and if he or she leaves this Church, it
            must be done by crawling over or under or around the Book of Mormon to make that exit.” (Safety for the
            Soul, General Conference October 2009)
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            <strong>Russell M. Nelson</strong>: “This appeal to all people must involve many languages and the work of
            skilled
            translators. The King James Version of the Bible, for example, was produced by 50 English scholars who
            accomplished their work in seven years, translating at the rate of one page per day. Expert translators
            today do well if they can also translate scripture at the rate of one page per day.
            <br><br>
            “In contrast, Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon at the rate of about 10 pages per day, completing
            the task in about 85 days! (Many of us feel good if we can read the book in that time.)” (Russell M. Nelson,
            October 1999 General Conference)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            In this final overview on the Book of Mormon, I want to focus on a few aspects of how the Book of Mormon was
            authored, looking at the timeline of when it was written, how Joseph Smith pulled from surrounding ideas and
            materials to create the book, and an example from the Book of Mormon that shows exactly how Joseph Smith was
            able to pull from multiple sources in the Bible to create what is one of the more famous stories in the Book
            of Mormon.
        </p>

        <h3>The Book of Mormon Production Timeline</h3>

        <p>
            As Russell Nelson’s quote above illustrates, one of the areas where the church proclaims the Book of Mormon
            a miracle is the timeline of the translation. Nelson above states that the Book of Mormon was completed in
            just 85 days, which on the surface does seem quite amazing for a book that is over 270,000 words. When you
            take a deeper look, however, it becomes not just doable, but ordinary.
            <br><br>
            First, what Russell Nelson does not mention in his quote is that Joseph Smith began talking about the Book
            of Mormon in 1823 when he first began to speak about the gold plates during his days in treasure digging.
            During this time Joseph Smith claimed to receive visions from the treasure guardian who was described as
            Nephi originally, and then Moroni in subsequent retellings.
            <br><br>
            Over the course of the years following the story of the gold plates in 1823, Joseph Smith would tell the
            Book of Mormon stories to his family at night. Remember that in this time there was no TV, so families would
            often tell stories at night, which is a form of communication that might feel foreign to us today. Joseph
            Smith’s mother, Lucy Mack Smith, recalls Joseph Smith’s stories about the Book of Mormon people before he
            even claimed to have the plates:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “From this time forth Joseph continued to receive instructions from time to time, and every evening we
            gathered our children together and gave our time up to the discussion of those things which he instructed to
            us… In the course of our evening conversations, Joseph gave us some of the most amusing recitals which could
            be imagined. He would describe the ancient inhabitants of this continent, their dress, their manner of
            traveling, the animals which they rode, the cities that they built, and the structure of their buildings
            with every particular, their mode of warfare, and their religious worship as specifically as though he had
            spent his life with them… The angel informed him at one time that he might make an effort to obtain the
            plates <on> the <22nd of the> ensueing September.” (1845 manuscript of Lucy Mack Smith's autobiography)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            While Joseph Smith was not dictating the Book of Mormon during this time, he was working out the details of
            the story through telling the stories to his family. This is important because it shows that even in the
            years before he even claimed to have plates, Joseph Smith was already working on the story down to the
            details of their clothes, mode of warfare, and even animals they rode. As a side note, they did not ride
            animals in Book of Mormon times in the Americas, but again that is what Joseph Smith would be familiar with
            as Native Americans in his time did ride horses.
            <br><br>
            After Joseph Smith claimed to retrieve the plates in 1827, he began the dictation process with Emma Smith
            and Martin Harris in 1828. As we covered in the lost 116 pages overview, Martin Harris took the manuscript
            and loses it in June 1828.
            <br><br>
            Following the loss of the 116 pages, Joseph Smith took about nine more months before restarting the
            translation process. During this time, Joseph Smith was able to think through and develop the story further,
            come up with a game plan to address the 116 pages if they could not be recovered, and got a “do over” for
            anything in the first 116 pages that he thought could be improved.
            <br><br>
            In other words, Joseph Smith had about 5.5 years from the moment he claimed there were gold plates in
            September 1823 until the Book of Mormon as we have it today was started in early 1829. During that time he
            would tell stories to his family about the Book of Mormon people, wars, and religious beliefs, and he was
            able to use the break after the lost 116 pages to further develop the story and become more efficient in
            dictation following that experience in dictating the story.
            <br><br>
            While the church always cites the 85 days that Joseph Smith ‘translated’ the Book of Mormon (some even like
            to move it to 75 days), Joseph Smith had been working on developing the story for 5.5 years prior to
            restarting the translation after the lost of the 116 pages, which is more than clear from Lucy Mack Smith’s
            retellings about Joseph telling stories about the Book of Mormon starting in 1823.
        </p>

        <h3>The Math of the Book of Mormon Translation</h3>

        <p>
            Examining the math behind the Book of Mormon translation process reveals that it is not as extraordinary as
            often portrayed. Historian John Hamer explains that once we break down the timeline and workload, the
            process appears straightforward rather than miraculous.
            <br><br>
            The Book of Mormon contains 273,725 words. Dividing this by the 85 days referenced by Russell Nelson, we get
            a daily requirement of about 3,200 words. This includes large segments of the Bible that were incorporated
            into the Book of Mormon, which likely required less time, as they could be copied with minor modifications.
            <br><br>
            A typical speaker can dictate between 7,500 to 9,000 words per hour, although the limiting factor in this
            case would be the scribe's ability to keep up. On average, a scribe can write approximately 1,200 legible
            words per hour. At this pace, Joseph Smith would only need to dictate for around three hours each day to
            meet the timeline.
            <br><br>
            Even if we consider a slower pace, where Oliver Cowdery might only write 600 words per hour, that would
            still require fewer than six hours of work per day. This would allow time for Joseph Smith to dictate in
            sessions, taking breaks as needed. Contemporary accounts mention that he took breaks to relax, skip rocks,
            eat, and give both himself and Oliver a chance to rest.
            <br><br>
            When viewed through this lens, the timeframe is reasonable, and claims about its impossibility seem
            overstated. This framing often serves to emphasize a miraculous quality where a realistic, explainable
            process suffices. Similarly, efforts to portray Joseph Smith as having limited intelligence during this
            period aim to enhance the perception of the timeline’s impossibility, when, in reality, it’s fully within
            human capacity.
            <br><br>
            In fact, not only is the timeline entirely plausible, but it becomes less remarkable upon closer inspection.
            The original Book of Mormon manuscript also undercuts claims of perfection. While the church asserts that
            the text was produced without edits, the book has undergone over 100,000 revisions since then, which have
            polished and improved the initial work.
        </p>

        <img src="images/authorship-1.webp" alt="BoM manuscript" class="image-style-big">

        <p>

            Just reading through a section of the <a
                href="https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/book-of-mormon-manuscript-excerpt-circa-june-1829-1-nephi-22b-318a/1#full-transcript">original
                manuscript</a> is helpful in understanding that this was an
            orally dictated story, which accounts for the long sentences without any punctuation. This is important
            because it helps us to understand that Joseph Smith was dictating the story to his scribe, and that there is
            no reason to believe in any theory such as the Spaulding manuscript theory that he was plagiarizing another
            text.
            <br><br>
            To be clear, the only book that Joseph Smith is directly using as a source text is the King James Bible,
            which we have covered in many of the previous overviews showing direct use in the Book of Mormon.
        </p>

        <h3>How Joseph Smith Authored the Book of Mormon</h3>

        <p>
            The first key point in this overview is that no one can say with absolute certainty how Joseph Smith created
            the Book of Mormon. While there are accounts from those around him that he used a seer stone placed in a
            hat, we have limited information beyond this.
            <br><br>
            The church accepts Joseph Smith’s claim that he translated the book by the “gift and power of God,” a broad
            phrase that, as discussed in the tight vs. loose translation theories and the “catalyst theory” for the Book
            of Abraham, could be indistinguishable from mere invention.
            <br><br>
            In this overview, I won’t speculate on the exact method Joseph Smith used to create the book, as the
            historical records documenting his dictation process with Oliver Cowdery are sparse. Instead, we can examine
            how the Book of Mormon’s content reveals that Smith was likely the author through a process of oral
            dictation, consistent with accounts of the translation process.
            <br><br>
            Evidence suggests that Joseph Smith drew from a range of sources while composing the Book of Mormon. This
            allows us to identify the “fingerprints” of the author on the text—a common method scholars use to analyze
            ancient works. For instance, scholars have precisely dated the Book of Daniel to 167-164 BCE by observing
            that the author’s prophecies are specific up until 167 BCE but become vague or incorrect afterward.
            <br><br>
            The Book of Mormon contains similar elements, such as a prophecy about Christopher Columbus (1 Nephi
            13:12-15) over 300 years before the Book of Mormon’s creation and another about the American Revolution (1
            Nephi 13:16-19) just 50 years prior. Furthermore, as discussed in the ‘Surrounding Influences’ overview, the
            Book of Mormon reflects events and ideas prevalent in Joseph Smith’s environment. Smith even wrote Martin
            Harris’s visit to Charles Anthon into the book, modifying passages from Isaiah to support prophecy.
            <br><br>
            Lehi’s dream also closely mirrors a dream experienced by Joseph Smith’s father before the Book of Mormon was
            written. This, along with self-referential prophecies in which Joseph Smith alludes to his own future role
            in revealing the book, further embeds his influence within the text.
            <br><br>
            Additionally, the Book of Mormon warns about “secret combinations,” a reference to Freemasonry, which held
            significant cultural weight in Joseph Smith’s day, especially after the disappearance of William Morgan in
            1826. Morgan had intended to expose Masonic rituals, an event that caused widespread anti-Masonic sentiment.
            Notably, the Masonic signs and tokens would later appear in Smith’s endowment ceremony shortly after he
            became a Mason in Nauvoo—a topic for a future overview.
            <br><br>
            The Book of Mormon’s references to contemporary events support its dating to the 19th century. Its
            prophecies and themes are specific up to Joseph Smith’s time, but they become notably vague afterward, with
            no mention of later historical events like the Civil War, Civil Rights Movement, LGBT rights, or women’s
            rights. Just as with the Book of Daniel, the details in the Book of Mormon reflect the era in which it was
            written, ceasing to correspond with events beyond Smith’s lifetime.
            <br><br>
            In essence, the Book of Mormon serves as a time capsule of religious beliefs from Joseph Smith’s era.
            Throughout these overviews, we’ve seen how each aspect of the book connects, forming a clearer picture of
            its origins.
            <br><br>
            As noted in many overviews, Joseph Smith relied heavily on the King James Bible (KJV) as a primary source
            for the Book of Mormon. This reliance introduced many of the KJV’s errors into the Book of Mormon, yet it
            also illustrates Smith’s skill in compiling and repurposing sources to create a new text.
        </p>

        <h3>The Book of Mormon and the Parable of the Olive Tree</h3>

        <p>
            A great example of how Joseph Smith used the King James Bible and outside sources to create the Book of
            Mormon is the parable/allegory of the olive tree in Jacob 5. In this famous story from the Book of Mormon,
            Jacob retells an allegory from Zenos that was recorded on the brass plates that were retrieved from Laban.
            <br><br>
            This chapter of Jacob is referenced by church apologists as evidence for the Book of Mormon’s divine
            origins, because there’s simply no way that Joseph Smith could have known about olive horticulture in his
            time, and Daniel C. Peterson writes the following:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            One of the single most famous chapters in the Book of Mormon is Jacob 5, which recounts a lengthy olive tree
            allegory that it credits to a pre-Lehite Old World prophet, unknown to the Bible, that it identifies as
            Zenos…
            <br><br>
            According to an article by several professional botanists:
            <blockquote>
                “Nearly all of the allegory in Jacob 5 corresponds exceptionally well with both ancient and modern
                botanical principles and horticultural practices. . . . It is hard to imagine that its author was not
                personally familiar with the minute details and practices involved in raising good olives in a
                Mediterranean climate. <sup>(163)</sup>”
            </blockquote>
            Moreover, although some very limited information about olive cultivation might be derivable through careful,
            focused study of the Bible and a few other books that were available during Joseph Smith’s early years
            (though likely not anywhere near where he lived), they contained only sparse details. And here’s another
            problem:

            <blockquote>
                “Joseph Smith probably had little knowledge of olive trees in New York, as they will not grow in the
                northeastern United States. <sup>(163)</sup>”” (Some Notes on Olive Cultivation and the Book of Mormon)
            </blockquote>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            What is great about this article by Peterson is that he is intentionally setting up the familiar concept of
            “how could Joseph have known” while also tucking in that little detail about “although some very limited
            information about olive cultivation might be derivable through careful, focused study of the Bible.” Put
            another way, Peterson knows that what we see in Jacob 5 can be found in the Bible, and yet the author of
            Offenders for a Word: How Anti-Mormons Play Word Games to Attack the Latter-day Saints is using his own word
            game to present Jacob 5 as impossible for Joseph Smith to have known.
            <br><br>
            I wanted to set that up first because Jacob 5 is a perfect example of how Joseph Smith was able to aggregate
            surrounding ideas to create the Book of Mormon, and how this also led to Joseph Smith making mistakes that
            are now identifiable by scholars.
            <br><br>
            From a very good <a href="https://2think.org/hundredsheep/bom/zenos.shtml">write-up on the parable of the
                olive tree</a>:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “There are two major Biblical passages that provided structural material for this parable, and a number of
            shorter passages that supplied secondary ideas. The primary passages are Isaiah's parable of the vineyard,
            contained in Isaiah 5:1-7 and Paul's discussion of the relationship of Israel to the Gentiles (Romans
            11:16-24), in which he used the metaphor of an olive tree.” (<a
                href="https://2think.org/hundredsheep/bom/zenos.shtml">The Parable of Zenos</a>)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Right off the bat we can see that Joseph Smith is not only pulling material from the King James Bible, but
            that he’s pulling from the New Testament which would not have been on the plates of brass or knowable to
            Zenos or anyone in that time. That is a problem that we’ve discussed before, but again needs to be noted
            that any reference to Romans is entirely anachronistic. Back to the article:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “That these two passages provided the framework upon which Joseph Smith built his parable is evident from
            several sources. Firstly, both passages were quoted by Smith earlier in the Book of Mormon narrative.
            Isaiah's song of the vineyard is found in II Nephi 15; Paul was alluded to in I Nephi 10:12-14 and other
            passages.
            <br><br>
            Secondly, several ideas presented in Zenos' parable can be found in these two passages. The theme of a
            well-tended vineyard, which failed to produce good fruit, is also a major theme of Isaiah's passage.
            Likewise, the contrast between wild and tame (or natural) fruit is found in Isaiah. From Paul's discourse,
            Joseph Smith obtained the idea of wild and natural branches, as well as one of his other major themes, that
            of cross-grafting branches between trees. We even find a few verbatim quotes from Isaiah, specifically the
            landowner's lament 'What could I have done more for my vineyard?' (Jacob 5:41). This is echoed in Isaiah's
            parable 'What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it?' (Isaiah 5:4)
            <br><br>
            The most telling piece of evidence, however, is that fact that the two passages are built on slightly
            different metaphors. Isaiah used a vineyard to represent Israel (Isaiah 5:7), while Paul used an olive tree.
            In the light of this, it is significant that the prophet Zenos appears to display some confusion about his
            metaphor. The parable of the vineyard begins with Israel as an olive tree located in a vineyard (Jacob 5:3).
            However, halfway through the narrative, the metaphor suddenly switches to the vineyard itself,
            significantly, just at the point that the Book of Mormon quotes Isaiah (Jacob 5:41). From this point on, the
            author repeatedly refers to 'the trees of the vineyard', apparently forgetting that the parable started out
            with olive trees as the primary metaphor, not grapevines.” (<a

        </blockquote>

        <p>
            To be clear, Joseph Smith is utilizing two main sources to create the parable of the olive tree, and we can
            see exactly when Joseph Smith switches between these two sources (Paul and Isaiah) due to how the metaphor
            itself changes from olive trees to the vineyard. Back to the article:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “There are at least three shorter passages that provided structural material for Zenos' parable. The concept
            of the Lord of the Vineyard and his servant, for example, is found in one of Jesus' parables, recorded in
            Luke 13:6-9. From this passage, we find the source of Smith's repeated reference to the useless branches
            'cumbering' the ground and the trees (Jacob 5:9,30,44,49,66). It is from this passage, too, that Smith
            obtained the references to 'digging and dunging' (Jacob 5:47,64,76). We also here find the servant
            counseling his master against the wholesale destruction of the vineyard, a scene which is repeated in Zenos'
            parable (Jacob 5:26,27 and Jacob 5:49,50).
            <br><br>
            The concept of unfruitful branches being hewn down and burnt (Jacob 5:42,46,47,49,66) is found in Matthew
            3:10 and John 15:6. Matthew 3:10 was quoted verbatim in Alma 5:52 (which was dictated before the book of
            Jacob, according to some theories). Verse 8 of Matthew 3, ('Bring forth therefore fruits meet for
            repentance') is quoted several times in the Book of Mormon (Alma 12:15;13:13;34:30).
            <br><br>
            As an interesting aside, it should be noted that Ethan Smith referred to several of these source passages in
            the View of the Hebrews. On page 62, we find a reference to Israel being "grafted in again". On page 254,
            the author quotes Luke "why cumbereth it the ground?". Ethan Smith also quoted and expounded on large
            portions of Isaiah, specifically with regard to Israel's restoration. He quoted Isaiah 5:26 on page 235, and
            Isaiah 5:13 on page 236. He also referred to the ripening of the vineyard as a sign of the end-times on page
            243.
            <br><br>
            Thus we see that rather than representing an actual ancient parable, Zenos' story of the Vineyard is
            actually a conflation of several sources, some of which would not even be written for several hundred
            years.” (<a href="https://2think.org/hundredsheep/bom/zenos.shtml">The Parable of Zenos</a>)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            I realize this might seem like a long example, but it is so critically important to understanding how Joseph
            Smith authored the Book of Mormon.
            <br><br>
            Above we see that apologist Daniel Peterson carefully stated “although some very limited information about
            olive cultivation might be derivable through careful, focused study of the Bible and a few other books that
            were available during Joseph Smith’s early years,” which we can then show through the text itself is exactly
            what happened.
            <br><br>
            Furthermore, it is crucial to understanding that Joseph Smith incorporated these passages earlier in the
            Book of Mormon, which shows that Joseph Smith both knew of these sources and was already thinking about them
            prior to creating this parable.
            <br><br>
            Not only can we see that Joseph Smith was aware of these passages in the Bible in the two books preceding
            Jacob, but we can see in the text of Jacob 5 exactly where Joseph Smith switches from using Paul’s writings
            to create the parable to Isaiah as the metaphor switches suddenly.
            <br><br>
            These are all fingerprints that help us to show that the Book of Mormon cannot be a historical record, and
            throughout the Book of Mormon they tell us that Joseph Smith is the author. This particular example shows us
            not just that Joseph Smith was using the KJV to produce the text, but that he was so familiar with the KJV
            that he was pulling directly from five sources in the parable of the olive tree.
            Joseph Smith was not just pulling material from both Isaiah 5 and Romans 11, but he was using exact phrases
            from Luke, Matthew, and John. This is important to understand because a common argument is that Joseph Smith
            was uneducated and not literate in the Bible. Remember this famous Emma Smith quote:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “When he stopped for any purpose at any time he would, when he commenced again, begin where he left off
            without any hesitation, and one time while he was translating he stopped suddenly, pale as a sheet, and
            said, ‘Emma, did Jerusalem have walls around it?’ When I answered, ‘Yes,’ he replied, ‘Oh! [I didn’t know.]
            I was afraid I had been deceived.’ He had such a limited knowledge of history at that time that he did not
            even know that Jerusalem was surrounded by walls.” (Edmund C. Briggs, “A Visit to Nauvoo in 1856,” Journal
            of History, Jan. 1916, p. 454.)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This is such a great quote because it shows that Joseph Smith was gifted at creating confidence in his
            perceived gifts. I outlined this in great detail when looking at how Joseph Smith was able to sell his
            services as a treasure/money digger, but this quote is another perfect example of this.
            <br><br>
            It is beyond clear that Joseph Smith was extremely familiar with the Bible, so the idea that Jerusalem had
            walls would have been known to Joseph Smith. Furthermore, the idea that Jerusalem having walls would be the
            detail that would strike Joseph Smith as being deceived is simply ridiculous. But by making this comment
            (and we’re assuming here that Emma is not making this story up), he is creating more belief in his claims of
            divinity in the eyes of his first wife Emma. When you read this quote knowing just how well Joseph Smith
            knew the Bible, it becomes even clearer how he was able to build charisma as a treasure digger and, later,
            the founder of a church.

        <h3>Inconsistencies Following the Replacement Text for the Lost 116 Pages</h3>

        <p>
            We’ve covered many of the instances where we can show through the dictation order that the Lost 116 Pages
            seem to know the ending of the Book of Mormon before the middle prophets, which is an indicator that Joseph
            Smith authored the Book of Mormon. Otherwise there is simply no way to explain the inconsistencies. A good
            example of this that I have not previously covered is the use of Malachi in the Book of Mormon.
            <br><br>
            Malachi was written in the “first half of the 5th century BCE, for it clearly presupposes the reconstructed
            Temple (dedicated in 516 BCE) but does not reflect the reconstitution of the religious community that took
            place under Nehemiah and Ezra about 450 BCE.” (<a
                href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Book-of-Malachi">Britannica</a>)
            <br><br>
            This is important because the book of Malachi was written after Lehi left with the brass plates, and in this
            case the author of the Book of Mormon is aware of this issue. We know this because when Jesus visits the
            Nephites, He declares the following:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            3 Nephi 26:2 These scriptures, which ye had not with you, the Father commanded that I should give unto you;
            for it was wisdom in him that they should be given unto future generations.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This verse is referencing the extensive use of Malachi in 3 Nephi 24 and 25. A key verse in the copying of
            Malachi comes in 3 Nephi 25:1
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            3 Nephi 25:1 For behold, the day cometh that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do
            wickedly, shall be stubble; and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of Hosts, that it
            shall leave them neither root nor branch.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            As the Book of Mormon tells us, this is a verse that was unavailable to the Nephites until Jesus revealed it
            to them. However, this verse works its way into both 1st and 2nd Nephi:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            1 Nephi 22:15 For behold, saith the prophet, the time cometh speedily that Satan shall have no more power
            over the hearts of the children of men; <strong>for the day soon cometh that all the proud and they who do
                wickedly
                shall be as stubble; and the day cometh that they must be burned</strong>.
            <br><br>
            1 Nephi 22:23 …<strong>they are those who must be consumed as stubble; and this is according to the words of
                the
                prophet.</strong>
            <br><br>
            2 Nephi 26:4 Wherefore,<strong> all those who are proud, and that do wickedly, the day that cometh shall
                burn them
                up, saith the Lord of Hosts, for they shall be as stubble</strong>.
            <br><br>
            2 Nephi 26:6 …for the fire of the anger of the Lord shall be kindled against them, and <strong>they shall be
                as
                stubble</strong>, and the day that cometh shall consume them, saith the Lord of Hosts.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This is a clear example where the ending of the Book of Mormon tells us that these writings were
            inaccessible to the Nephites, yet in the replacement text for ‘lost 116 pages,’ which was written after the
            ending was completed, the prophets are suddenly aware of material that Jesus specifically said was
            unavailable to them.
            <br><br>
            Just as stated in the Lost 116 Pages overview, this is a clear example where the dictation order reveals
            fingerprints as to the author of the Book of Mormon. Remember that Joseph Smith composed the Book of Mormon
            starting with Mosiah until the end, and only then replaced the ‘lost’ text with 1 Nephi through Mormon. From
            historian Brent Metcalfe:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “Mosiah through 3 Nephi 23 betrays no knowledge of Malachi 3-4. Subsequent to Jesus’s 3 Nephi recital of
            Malachi’s prophecies, as the dictation proceeded, Malachi’s language is appropriated by other Book of Mormon
            prophets in Ether, 1 Nephi, and 2 Nephi.
            <br><br>
            Some Book of Mormon students argue that narrative patterns similar to the above can be explained by
            acknowledging the intervention of Nephite redactors Mormon and Moroni. Interpreters could thus hypothesize
            that post-Christ-advent Nephite editors embellished the replacement text with high christology or projected
            later prophecies back on their progenitors (cf. Epperson 1988, 80, 94-96, 98-99; Jorgensen 1981, passim;
            Ostler 1987, 86-87).
            <br><br>
            Such a theory can only be maintained at the expense of the redactors’ integrity. Mormon expressly states
            that the sole reason for inclusion of 1 Nephi-Omni was because they contained “pleasing … prophecies of the
            coming of Christ” (W of M 1:4[ff]). In this context, could the christological prophecies be the creation of
            Mormon? Also, why would Mormon or Moroni have inserted later, more developed elements into the narrative in
            some cases but neglected to do so in the homilies of Benjamin, Mosiah, Abinadi, and both Almas? And why
            would such inconsistencies of ancient redactors be so easily explained by Smith’s dictation sequence?”
            (Metcalfe, New Approaches to the Book of Mormon)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Again, these inconsistencies with the replacement text of the ‘lost 116 pages’ are only inconsistencies when
            the Book of Mormon is read in chronological order of the text today. When the Book of Mormon is read through
            the order it was dictated it as stated above, however, the puzzle pieces fit together exactly as you would
            expect. This is another area where you can show that Joseph Smith was the author of the Book of Mormon, and
            in his need to replace the Lost 116 Pages he unintentionally revealed a lot of clues as to how the book was
            created.
        </p>

        <h3>Other Fingerprints from Orally Dictating the Book of Mormon</h3>

        <p>
            As I’ve pointed out in these overviews, there are many places where Joseph Smith leaves his fingerprints on
            the text itself. I agree with many scholars that the Book of Mormon was an orally dictated text, where
            Joseph Smith would speak the words to Oliver Cowdery, and thus could not just go back and make changes as he
            wanted because of the underlying premise that he was reading off the stone in a hat.
            <br><br>
            Because it was an orally composed text, there are many hints that tell us that Joseph Smith would sometimes
            misspeak, and thus need to correct himself immediately. This is important because we are being told that
            Joseph Smith is reading the text off of his seer/peep stone in a hat, and that the words cannot change until
            they are written down correctly.
            <br><br>
            That means in these cases that, from a faithful perspective, we have to believe they were engraved onto the
            metal plates with these errors, which they then to had to spend more time engraving the correction
            immediately after.
            <br><br>
            Here are some examples where I believe Joseph Smith made an error, quickly realized it, and then had to
            correct it in the following part of the sentence:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            Mosiah 16:6 And now if Christ had not come into the world [Mistake], speaking of things to come as though
            they had already come [Correction], there could have been no redemption.
            <br><br>
            Helaman 12:15 And thus, according to his word the earth goeth back, and it appeareth unto man that the sun
            standeth still [Mistake]; yea, and behold, this is so; for surely it is the earth that moveth and not the
            sun.
            <br><br>
            Mosiah 7:8 And it came to pass when they had been in prison two days they were again brought before the
            king, and their bands were loosed; and they stood before the king, and were permitted [Mistake], or rather
            commanded [Correction], that they should answer the questions which he should ask them.
            <br><br>
            Alma 43:38 ...they being shielded from the more vital parts of the body [Mistake], or the more vital parts
            of the body being shielded from the strokes of the Lamanites [Correction]...
            <br><br>
            Alma 24:19 ...and thus we see that they buried their weapons of peace [Mistake], or they buried the weapons
            of war, for peace. [Correction]
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            In addition to areas where Joseph Smith corrects himself immediately after realizing he dictated an error,
            we have multiple instances where you can see how Joseph Smith loses his train of thought while dictating and
            it leads to either awkward errors or the need to circle back to the original point. From the Mormon Stories
            essay on the Book of Mormon translation:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “In multiple places, the narrator appears to forget what he had previously dictated and is forced to resort
            to verbal circumlocution. If the words were indeed carefully abridged by Mormon, they are difficult to
            reconcile. However, such lapses are easily explained by a break in dictation for the night or simply a lapse
            in concentration.
            <br><br>
            “Alma 19:16 introduces a Lamanite woman named Abish, and informs that she “ran forth from house to house,
            making it known unto the people” that the power of God had come upon the king and queen. A mere twelve
            verses later, the narrator forgets her name and clumsily refers instead to “…the woman servant who had
            caused the multitude to be gathered together.”
            <br><br>
            Similarly, Alma 1 introduces an Antichrist named Nehor, who teaches false doctrine, kills a war hero named
            Gideon, and finally recants his unbelief before his execution for murder. In the very next chapter, the
            author appears to momentarily forget Nehor’s name, and introduces a new character, Amlici, as “he being
            after the order of the man that slew Gideon by the sword, who was executed according to the law.” Later, in
            Alma 24, the author uses the much simpler description, “after the order of Nehor.”
            <br><br>
            On the other hand, we occasionally encounter more information just a few verses after it would have flowed
            most easily. In Alma 17:36, narrating how Ammon defended King Lamoni’s sheep from would-be thieves, Joseph
            dictates that, “with mighty power he did sling stones amongst them; and thus he slew a certain number of
            them.” Two verses later, we are informed that “six of them had fallen by the sling..but he slew none save it
            were their leader with his sword.” (<a

        </blockquote>

        <h3>Unique Names in the Book of Mormon</h3>

        <p>
            One common defense of the Book of Mormon is that it contains so many unique names and places that there is
            just no way that Joseph Smith could have invented them all and kept track of them throughout the book. A
            good example of this is a statement from Sunday School General President Tad R. Callister, who wrote the
            book A Case For the Book of Mormon:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “First, the critics must explain how Joseph Smith, a 23-year-old farm boy with limited education, created a
            book with hundreds of unique names and places, as well as detailed stories and events. Accordingly, many
            critics propose that he was a creative genius who relied upon numerous books and other local resources to
            create the historical content of the Book of Mormon. But contrary to their assertion, there is not a
            solitary witness who claims to have seen Joseph with any of these alleged resources before the translation
            began.” (October 2017 General Conference)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            I recently wrote about how Tad Callister uses strawman arguments to deflect critical points against the Book
            of Mormon. This is yet another instance where the church frames Joseph Smith’s actions as miraculous, when,
            in fact, a more straightforward explanation emerges when we remove the supernatural element.
            <br><br>
            We’ve already covered how Joseph Smith likely relied on available books and current events to compose the
            Book of Mormon. We also discussed the problems with Callister’s claim that no witnesses saw Smith using
            external sources, given the clear literary dependence on the King James Bible.
            <br><br>
            Before we conclude, I want to briefly address the names in the Book of Mormon, as they further support the
            idea that the book was orally dictated by Joseph Smith.
            <br><br>
            If we examine the names, we see that many appear only once, and most are concentrated within specific
            sections. Essentially, Joseph Smith would dictate a section, complete it, and then move on, rarely
            revisiting the names or places he’d introduced as the narrative progressed.
            <br><br>
            In other words, he isn’t ‘remembering hundreds of unique names and locations’ across the Book of Mormon—a
            detail that undermines the argument that this task would have been impossible for him. Because the book's
            storyline constantly moves forward in time, Smith could easily move on from names and details shortly after
            introducing them, something he does consistently throughout, except for the main characters.
            <br><br>
            From a <a href="https://gospelcougar.blogspot.com/2007/12/word-frequency-in-book-of-mormon.html">page</a>
            that gives a frequency count of every word in the Book of Mormon, a few example of the frequency of mentions
            by name:

        <p>
            I picked this list just browsing through a chart of word frequency in the Book of Mormon and I am no means
            saying this is an exhaustive list, but I hope the point is clear that outside of the main characters and
            places, all of those unique names are quickly used and forgotten. This is not like Lord of the Rings calling
            back characters throughout the book that are unique to Middle Earth or Harry Potter creating a universe that
            constantly calls back places and names – the Book of Mormon is a story that is moving through time and thus
            is constantly changing and replacing characters and places.
            <br><br>
            Finally, we can show that many of the names in the Book of Mormon are similar to other names around him. For
            example, Charles Anthon compiled a dictionary of ancient names in 1827 that has a lot of similarities with
            Book of Mormon names. Some examples are:

        </div>

        <p>
            There are also a lot of sections on Egyptian culture and Egyptian theology. Joseph Smith would by this book
            alone knew that the word Nephi was of Egyptian origin (page 520)
            <br><br>
            Please visit <a
                href="https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/charles-anthon-proper-names-and-the-bom/">“Charles
                Anthon's Proper Names and the Book of Mormon”</a> for a list of 32 names similar to the
            Book of Mormon with links.
            <br><br>
            As I’ve stated before, I’m not saying that Joseph Smith plagiarized the Book of Mormon or directly stole all
            of these names from Anthon, but I am stating that we can detail over and over again where he is pulling from
            outside sources. We also know that Joseph Smith was familiar with Charles Anthon’s work to the point of
            sending Martin Harris to him as a respected scholar of ancient languages.
            <br><br>
            We can also show many names are taken from the Bible, with Nephi coming from the Apocrypha which was well
            known in Joseph Smith’s time:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            2 Maccabees 1:36, King James Bible: “And Neemias called this thing Naphthar, which is as much as to say, a
            cleansing: but many men call it Nephi.”
            <br><br>
            2 Nephi 5:8 “And my people would that we should call the name of the place Nephi; wherefore, we did call it
            Nephi.”
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Again, I am not saying that these are being directly pulled as we’ve shown in other areas with the King
            James Bible, but to say that these names are not nearly as unique as the church wants to proclaim, and the
            number of names is not nearly as impressive once you realize that very few of them are used outside of very
            small sections in the Book of Mormon.
        </p>

        <h3>Summary</h3>

        <p>
            This is the ninth overview specifically about the Book of Mormon, and the sixteenth if we include the
            biblical scholarship sections about the scriptures of Mormonism. In a lot of ways this summary here is a
            summary of all sixteen overviews, because as I’ve said before I truly believe they are all puzzle pieces
            that work together to show us the complete picture in totality.
            <br><br>
            While it might feel like this summary is a bit long, I hope you’ll read it and understand just how deep
            these problems are and why they all need to be both looked at and answered in totality.
            <br><br>
            Throughout these overviews I’ve tried to show how the entire concept of the gold plates and Book of Mormon
            was an outgrowth of Joseph Smith’s treasure digging, which manifests itself in the story of recovering the
            gold plates, the translation of the plates, and the text of the Book of Mormon itself. I don’t think it can
            be overstated how important it is to understand how influential treasure digging is to the story of
            Mormonism, and why we have to accept treasure digging as being a real way of locating objects to accept the
            Book of Mormon as an ancient record on gold plates.
            <br><br>
            From that point we then have to believe that God would allow Joseph Smith to use the very same rock that he
            claimed to see this buried treasure with (which is why we have to accept treasure digging as a genuine
            practice that located lost items) to dictate the Book of Mormon instead of the interpreters the book itself
            tells us were preserved for the very purpose of translating. While some fringe apologists still contend that
            the “rock in a hat” was a hoax, the church itself now admits that is how the Book of Mormon was translated.
            <br><br>
            After you accept the rock in a hat for translation, you then have to accept that Joseph Smith could not
            replicate the ‘Lost 116 Pages’ even though he was claiming a tight translation, and thus needed revelation
            to create the idea of a second set of plates was preserved for this very purpose, even though the authors of
            the Book of Mormon are completely unaware of this second set of plates until the replacement text is created
            (which is after the end of the book is finished).
            <br><br>
            At this point we have the text of the Book of Mormon, so if you accept all of the above now we have to deal
            with the problems in the text itself. Because the Book of Mormon is literarily dependent on the King James
            Bible, we have to believe that God would allow for Joseph Smith to bring in translation errors into the Book
            of Mormon, even though it was originally written for the very purpose of providing us a book that had not
            lost its fullness through men translating it.
            <br><br>
            As I outlined in the biblical scholarship sections, the Book of Mormon requires that Adam and Eve are
            literal people who were the first humans ever, which is incredibly problematic by just looking at the text
            of the Bible itself. The Adam and Eve story was a late addition when the Pentateuch was compiled, likely
            after Lehi left with the brass plates.
            <br><br>
            From there it gets even more problematic. For the Book of Mormon to be true, we have to believe that the
            Tower of Babel was a literal event, with the languages of the world being confused after its destruction.
            Beyond the fact that there is no historical evidence for it, every secular linguist can explain why language
            development simply did not happen this way. Most religions can accept the Tower of Babel as an etiological
            myth, but the Book of Mormon requires it to be a literal event because Joseph Smith wrote it directly into
            the story.
            <br><br>
            Next we have to believe that the global flood occurred. Again, there is absolutely no evidence for this and
            ample evidence to show that a global flood that wiped out all living beings on land simply did not happen.
            But the Book of Mormon requires a global flood that baptized the Americas, leaving the lands uninhabited
            until God led the Jaredites here.
            <br><br>
            Even if we accept all of these problems with the Book of Mormon until this point, we still have many more to
            go. The Book of Mormon includes King James Bible sections that were simply unavailable to the Book of Mormon
            people, and yet they are included throughout the text.
            <br><br>
            The Sermon at the Temple, which is one of the crowning moments of the entire Book of Mormon, is a copy of
            the Sermon on the Mount from Matthew, making only superficial changes to problematic text while leaving in
            other errors and phrases that would have absolutely no meaning to the Nephites. Not only is this problematic
            because Joseph Smith is copying the text directly into the Book of Mormon, but scholars now believe Jesus
            never gave the sermon as written, but that the author of Matthew was using a “Q” or “sayings” source to
            weave the sayings of Jesus into a literary work.
            <br><br>
            We then run into these same problems with the “long ending of Mark,” where scholars do not believe that the
            ending of Mark was original to the author of Mark’s text because the earliest manuscripts do not contain it,
            which some Bibles even concede directly in the text.
        </p>

        <p>
            More significantly, the Book of Mormon contains sections of Isaiah that scholars now attribute to a second
            author, known as Deutero-Isaiah. While some scholars still argue for the existence of a single Isaiah, there
            is considerable evidence supporting the existence of both Deutero-Isaiah and Trito-Isaiah. Despite this, the
            themes of Deutero-Isaiah are interwoven throughout the Book of Mormon.
            <br><br>
            At this stage, it is overwhelmingly clear that the Book of Mormon is not an ancient text, as it incorporates
            material unavailable during the purported time of its composition, including extensive passages from the
            King James Bible, which wasn’t translated until 1611. It cannot be reasonably argued that the Book of Mormon
            is an ancient record. At best, it could be seen as an ancient text that Joseph Smith expanded upon.
            <br><br>
            However, even this explanation becomes problematic as we delve further into the Book of Mormon itself. The
            central purpose of the text is to bring the Lamanites back to Christ, and the notion of the Lamanites being
            cursed with dark skin is explicitly connected to the idea that Native Americans are their descendants. Yet,
            DNA evidence has definitively disproven this claim, leading the church to revise the introduction to the
            Book of Mormon.
        </p>

        <img src="images/dna-1.webp" alt="BoM title page change" class="image-style-medium">

        <p>
            Not only has DNA evidence disproven the idea that Native Americans are descendants of the Book of Mormon
            peoples, but migration studies have also demonstrated that the original inhabitants of the Americas migrated
            from Asia. These migrations occurred over 10,000 years prior to the Book of Mormon’s timeline, and long
            before the biblical story of Adam and Eve as the first humans.
            <br><br>
            For the Book of Mormon to be considered a true historical record, one would have to believe that the
            Americas were populated by much larger civilizations than the peoples described in the Book of Mormon, and
            that these civilizations were somehow "swallowed up," leaving no trace of their DNA. As with the Tower of
            Babel story, no non-LDS geneticist supports this claim, and the text of the Book of Mormon itself does not
            accommodate such an argument. Apologists have attempted to reconcile this by suggesting a larger, external
            civilization coexisted with the Book of Mormon peoples, but both the book’s text and Joseph Smith’s
            revelations are unequivocal in identifying Native Americans as the descendants of the Lamanites.
            <br><br>
            Even if we put aside this issue, we must then address the fact that Joseph Smith draws extensively from
            material available to him in the 1820s. As discussed in my overview on external influences, Smith
            incorporated elements of the Moundbuilder Myth directly into the Book of Mormon. This was a prevalent belief
            in his time, asserting that an advanced, ancient race had been wiped out by the "savage Indians." The Book
            of Mormon closely mirrors this belief, as demonstrated through contemporary accounts of the Moundbuilder
            Myth, but modern archaeology has since disproven this theory, even though it clearly influenced the text.
            <br><br>
            Furthermore, Joseph Smith included events from his own era in the Book of Mormon, which poses a significant
            issue if the book is supposed to be an ancient record revealed through divine means. I highlighted Joseph
            Smith’s incorporation of his father’s dream as Lehi’s dream, the anti-Masonic sentiments of the 1820s
            sparked by the disappearance of William Morgan (who threatened to reveal Masonic secrets), the visit of
            Martin Harris to Charles Anthon, treasure-digging terminology, and other contemporary influences that
            surrounded Joseph Smith.
            <br><br>
            This prompted Alexander Campbell, the leader of the Campbellites (a movement that would later influence the
            restoration of the priesthood), to remark:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “This prophet Smith, through his stone spectacles, wrote on the plates of Nephi, in this book of Mormon,
            every error and almost every truth discussed in New York for the last ten years. He decided all the great
            controversies;—infant baptism, ordination, the trinity, regeneration, repentance, justification, the fall of
            man, the atonement, transubstantiation, fasting, penance, church government, religious experience, the call
            to the ministry, the general resurrection, eternal punishment, who may baptize, and even the question of
            free masonary, republican government, and the rights of man. All these topics are repeatedly alluded to.”
            (Alexander Campbell, The Millennial Harbinger, Vol. 2:93)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            To be clear, the Book of Mormon was written to address the theological and societal questions of the 1820s,
            yet it fails to engage with issues relevant to our modern day. Furthermore, it lacks many key elements of
            Joseph Smith’s later theological developments, such as the separation of God and Jesus as distinct beings,
            the endowment ceremony, celestial marriage, polygamy (which the Book of Mormon condemns as an abomination),
            priesthood restoration, baptism for the dead, the plurality of gods, the idea that humans can become gods,
            and the concept of three degrees of heaven.
            <br><br>
            The only uniquely Mormon doctrine addressed in the Book of Mormon—non-infant baptism—was a hotly debated
            issue in Joseph Smith’s time, so much so that Alexander Campbell himself noted it in his critique. This is a
            revealing point, as it further illustrates that Joseph Smith crafted the Book of Mormon around the
            theological debates and concerns of his contemporary environment.
            <br><br>
            Additionally, we must account for the numerous anachronisms within the text. The Christology presented is
            far closer to 19th-century Protestant thought than any ancient understanding of Christ. The text also
            contains references to plants, animals, and technologies—such as steel, chariots, horses, wheat, and
            barley—that were not present in the ancient Americas. As I explained in the section on anachronisms,
            scholars can date the Book of Mormon to Joseph Smith’s time not only through these inaccuracies but also
            through the specific issues and concerns embedded in the narrative itself.
            <br><br>
            This dating process mirrors the way scholars can date the Book of Daniel, by analyzing how precise the
            author is about known events, versus how vague the prophecies become when they extend beyond the author’s
            time. The Book of Mormon follows a similar pattern, providing clear prophecies about the Revolutionary War
            and Columbus’s discovery of America, but offering no specific predictions beyond Joseph Smith’s era.
            <br><br>
            At this point, we are left with the task of explaining these issues in a way that is both rational and
            faithful. This often leads to debates between proponents of a "tight" vs. "loose" translation theory. The
            loose translation theory allows for Joseph Smith’s own thoughts and contemporary influences to filter into
            the text, explaining the anachronisms and other inconsistencies. However, historical accounts and evidence
            overwhelmingly support a "tight" translation process for the Book of Mormon, making the loose translation
            theory more a matter of convenience than of evidence. As outlined in the overview, apologists attempt to
            argue for both a tight and loose translation simultaneously, but this is untenable.
            <br><br>
            This brings us to the final conclusion regarding the Book of Mormon. Many church leaders and apologists
            claim that Joseph Smith could not have written the Book of Mormon within the 85 days it took to dictate.
            However, as we’ve demonstrated throughout this and other overviews, the Book of Mormon is not as unique or
            impressive as it has been made out to be, and its timeline is far from miraculous.
            <br><br>
            Simple math shows that Joseph Smith could have dictated the Book of Mormon for roughly three hours a day
            over those 85 days, leaving him ample time for breaks, planning, revisiting the manuscript, and studying the
            Bible to incorporate its content into the text.
            <br><br>
            By examining the text of the Book of Mormon, we can see how Joseph Smith borrowed from both the Bible and
            his contemporary surroundings to construct its stories. For example, the parable of the olive tree, which I
            detailed earlier, illustrates how Smith directly pulls from biblical passages, while also revealing the
            moment when he diverges from his source material. This pattern can be observed throughout the Book of
            Mormon, where specific events from Joseph Smith’s environment influenced sections of the text, including the
            creation of names and places.
            <br><br>
            If the Book of Mormon were truly as miraculous as the church claims, even non-LDS scholars would find
            intrinsic value in the text, regardless of whether they believed in its divine origins, as they do with the
            Bible. However, the reality is that the Book of Mormon is neither historical nor miraculous. This is a
            difficult realization for believing members, but becomes unavoidable when one steps away from preconceived
            conclusions and examines the totality of these issues.
            <br><br>
            Personally, when I concluded that the church wasn’t true, it wasn’t due to the Book of Mormon. It was
            because of issues like polygamy, racism towards Black people, and my experiences in the temple. Up until
            that point, I hadn’t critically examined the Book of Mormon, and as a convert, it felt familiar enough to
            the Bible that I simply accepted it as scripture.
            <br><br>
            In many ways, this explains why the Book of Mormon gained traction in the 1830s and beyond. The text
            provided exactly what people of Joseph Smith’s time expected—an origin story explaining the Native
            Americans' dark skin and "savage" nature as the result of their destruction of an ancient, superior white
            race. The religious revivals of the time further fueled this, as many were seeking new religious ideas, and
            the Book of Mormon delivered a modern Christology in an ancient setting, which fit well with the prevailing
            beliefs of the day.
            <br><br>
            If you’ve made it through all sixteen overviews on the Book of Mormon and biblical scholarship, I commend
            you. I know they’ve been long and detailed, but I hope they’ve helped connect the dots between the various
            problems and why they must be addressed collectively, rather than in isolation.
            <br><br>
            Now that we’ve completed our analysis of the Book of Mormon, it’s time to move on to Joseph Smith, early
            church history, and his other works, including the Book of Abraham, Doctrine and Covenants, and his Bible
            translation. There’s no better place to begin than with the evolving accounts of Joseph Smith’s First
            Vision.
