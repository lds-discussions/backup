        <h2>Annotated Analysis of the Official LDS Essay on the Book of Mormon Translation</h2>

        <p>
            The following is an annotated version of the official LDS-released essay titled "Book of Mormon
            Translation." This essay was published by the Church to provide an explanation of how the Book of Mormon was
            translated, addressing the discrepancies between the true translation process and the official Church
            narrative that has been taught since its founding. In this annotated version, all original text from the
            Church essay is presented in black, while our commentary and analysis appear in <span
                style="color: blue;">blue</span> . The official essay can
            be accessed directly on the <a
                href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics-essays/book-of-mormon-translation?lang=eng">LDS
                website</a>.
            This annotated essay is based on material from ongoing research, which is regularly updated. You can access
            the original, continuously updated source by clicking <a

            Historically, many Church leaders have labeled inquiries into topics like those discussed in this essay as
            "anti-Mormon." In some cases, members have been excommunicated for their research into Church history.
            However, with the rise of the internet, many of these historical issues have been brought to light,
            prompting the Church to address them. Despite this, significant concerns remain about the translation of the
            Book of Mormon, and some of the Church's responses have been criticized for being evasive or dismissive of
            the deeper issues.
            <br><br>
            This annotated essay is lengthy, but it is crucial to include all of the material presented here. Much of
            this information is unfamiliar to many Church members, and our additional notes offer insights that are new
            to almost all members. Understanding the true translation process of the Book of Mormon is essential,
            especially as it relates to the translation of the Book of Abraham and Joseph Smith's use of Adam Clarke's
            biblical commentaries in his Bible translation. These revelations raise serious questions about the accuracy
            of the scriptures Joseph Smith produced, which in turn brings into question his reliability as a prophet. As
            prominent LDS historian Richard Bushman <a
                href="https://medium.com/@jellistx/transcript-of-claudia-and-richard-bushmans-remarks-at-faith-again-e9d03bdea0e3">stated</a>,
            "<em>I think that for the Church to remain strong, it has to
                reconstruct its narrative. <strong>The dominant narrative is not true; it can’t be sustained</strong>.
                The
                Church has to
                absorb all this new information, or it will be on very shaky grounds, and that’s what it is trying to
                do. It
                will be a strain for a lot of people, older people especially. But I think it has to change.</em>"
            <br><br>
            As President George Albert Smith once remarked, “<em>If a faith will not bear to be investigated; if its
                preachers and professors are afraid to have it examined, their foundation must be very weak.</em>”

            Discourses, Volume 14, Page 216)

        <h3>Book of Mormon Translation</h3>

        <p>
            <a href="https://history.churchofjesuschrist.org/landing/joseph-smith-prophet-of-god?lang=eng">Joseph
                Smith</a> said that the <a href="https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/book-of-mormon">Book
                of Mormon</a> was <em>“the most correct of any Book on earth & the keystone of
                our
                religion & a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts than by any other
                Book.”</em><a
                href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics-essays/book-of-mormon-translation?lang=eng#1"><sup>1</sup></a>
            The Book of
            Mormon came into the world through a series of miraculous events. Much can be known about the coming forth
            of the English text of the Book of Mormon through a careful study of statements made by Joseph Smith, his
            scribes, and others closely associated with the translation of the Book of Mormon.
        </p>

        <h3>“By the Gift and Power of God”</h3>

        Joseph Smith reported that on the evening of September 21, 1823, while he prayed in the upper room of his
        parents’ small log home in Palmyra, New York, an angel who called himself Moroni appeared and told Joseph that
        <em>“God had a work for [you] to do.”</em><a
            href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics-essays/book-of-mormon-translation?lang=eng#2"><sup>2</sup></a>
        He informed Joseph that “there was a book deposited, written upon gold
        plates, giving an account of the former inhabitants of this continent, and the source from whence they sprang.”
        The book could be found in a hill not far from the Smith family farm. This was no ordinary history, for it
        contained <em>“the fullness of the everlasting Gospel as delivered by the Savior.”</em><a
            href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics-essays/book-of-mormon-translation?lang=eng#3"><sup>3</sup></a>

        <p>
            <span style="color: blue;">
                To fully grasp the significance of the September 21st date, and the major revelation this essay will
                soon
                present about the instrument used to translate the Book of Mormon, it's essential to first examine some
                key
                activities of Joseph Smith and his family before the Gold Plates came into play. While this may seem
                like a
                detour from the essay, it's crucial for gaining an accurate perspective.
                <br><br>
                First, it’s important to understand that the early history and timeline of the Church are not exactly as
                they are taught in lesson manuals or even in Joseph Smith’s History in the Pearl of Great Price. Church
                historians are beginning to acknowledge this discrepancy. Richard Bushman and other LDS scholars have
                accepted that, before Joseph Smith spoke of visitations from God, Jesus, and the angel Moroni, he
                participated in magical ceremonies aimed at persuading guardian spirits to reveal the locations of
                buried
                treasures. Bushman suggests that God may have used folk magic as a kind of preparatory phase for
                Joseph’s
                later spiritual calling (Rough Stone Rolling).
                <br><br>
                The date on which Joseph went to the hill to retrieve the plates—September 21—is highly significant in
                the
                context of folk magic and occult practices. It falls on the Autumnal Equinox, a time when, according to
                magical belief, the spirits of the dead are more accessible to mortals and more easily convinced to
                disclose
                the locations of buried treasures. This idea is rooted in the writings of occult figures like Heinrich
                Cornelius Agrippa, whose works were influential in early 19th-century America. More importantly,
                September
                21 is the specific date encoded in magic parchments owned by the Smith family, which they used to
                determine
                the optimal times for their treasure-hunting expeditions.

                It comes as something of a surprise to most Latter-Day Saints that the Smith family owned and used these
                magic parchments, along with a ceremonial dagger and other occult paraphernalia, to perform their
                mystical
                activities. Joseph’s mother, Lucy Mack Smith, described their progression from casual to intensive
                magical
                pursuits thus: “we stopt our labor and went at trying to win the faculty of Abrac drawing magic circles
                or
                sooth saying to the neglect of all kind of business.” (Joseph Smith Papers, Lucy Mack Smith, History,
                1844–1845). The “Abrac” to which Lucy refers is the magical practice of attempting to gain control over
                supernatural beings in the pursuit of material wealth through magical ceremonies. This typically
                involved
                two processes. First was the use of either a rodsman, who used a dowsing rod to divine the location of
                treasure (Oliver Cowdery did this), or a seer who located it by “glass-looking” into stone or glass
                object.
                Second was a ceremony to appease the guardian ghost by drawing a magical circle on the ground, marking
                it
                with occult symbols drawn with a ceremonial dagger, and sometimes performing an animal sacrifice before
                attempting to dig. The word Abrac, which Lucy uses, comes from the name of the demon Abraxas, who is
                associated with occult numerology and whose name is the source of the magical word “abracadabra” (Brown,
                S.
                M. Reconsidering Lucy Mack Smith’s Folk Magic Confession. Mormon Historical Studies).
                <br><br>
                Some of theSmith’s customers tell us that animals were indeed sacrificed on such occasions. One of the
                Smiths’ clients
                described it this way: “That a black sheep should be taken to the ground where the treasures were
                concealed
                – that after cutting its throat, it should be led around in a circle while bleeding. This being done,
                the
                wrath of the evil spirit would be appeased.” (Early Mormon Documents, Vol. 2, pp.59-61). LDS scholar M.
                Wilford Poulson assures us that the animals were obtained honorably. He says that Wallace Miner reported
                "I
                once asked Stafford if Smith did steal a sheep from him. He said no, not exactly. He said, he did miss a
                black sheep, but soon Joseph came and admitted he took it for sacrifice but he was willing to work for
                it."
                (Early Mormon Documents, Vol. 2, p. 197)
                <br><br>
                The Smiths’ magical documents are named by historians
                according to the writing that appears on each of them: the “Jehovah, Jehovah, Jehovah” parchment, the
                “Peter
                Bind Them” parchment, and the “Holiness to the Lord” parchment, from which Joseph Smith likely derived
                the
                declaration that now appears above the doors of LDS temples. The magic symbols on these documents were
                copied directly from occult texts, including The Magus by Francis Barrett, the New and Complete
                Illustration
                of Celestial Sciences by Ebenezer Sibly, and The Discoverie of Witchcraft by Reginald Scot.

                )
                <br><br>
                The date of September 21-22 is defined
                in these magical texts as the proper time to summon a treasure-guarding ghost. Joseph Smith’s
                interaction on
                21-22 September 1823 with the spirit who we now know as Angel Moroni fits the internal dating of his
                family's magic parchment. This personage was not given a name in the earliest references but was called
                Nephi in the official Joseph Smith Testimony for forty years until 1878 when it was edited for
                consistency
                and his name was changed to Moroni (Times and Seasons Vol. III pp. 749, 753, Millennial Star, vol. 3,
                p.53,
                Pearl of Great Price, 1851 edition, page 41). The date and time of Joseph’s September 1823 visitation
                complied with the instructions for spirit summoning incantations recorded by Scot, Agrippa, Sibly,
                Barrett
                and other occult writers (D. M. Quinn, Early Mormonism and the Magic World View, Chs. 1-4). Moroni/Nephi
                first appeared to Joseph on the night of the Autumnal equinox, between midnight and dawn, which was a
                date
                prescribed in the magical books for such encounters. Having failed to retrieve the plates on his first
                attempt, Joseph continued to visit the hill annually on the same date. He finally succeeded in obtaining
                the
                plates on the eve of the equinox in 1827, in the first hour after midnight. Witness accounts tell us
                that he
                finally found the correct magical prescription for success, which required him to arrive on that date
                and
                time, to bring a companion, in this case Emma, to dress in black clothing, and to ride a black horse,
                which
                he borrowed from Joseph Knight (Marquardt, Inventing Mormonism: Tradition and the Historical Record, Ch.
                5).

            The angel charged Joseph Smith to translate the book from the ancient language in which it was written. The
            young man, however, had very little formal education and was incapable of writing a book on his own, let
            alone translating an ancient book written from an unknown language, known in the Book of Mormon as “reformed
            Egyptian.”<a

        <p>
            <span style="color: blue;">
                The authors of this essay want to set the stage early on that Joseph was incapable of writing a book
                without even giving him the benefit of the doubt. <em>I think it is fair to say that there is a vast gap
                    between being uneducated and being stupid.</em> Should we conclude that Abraham Lincoln could not
                have become president of the United States or written the Gettysburg Address because he had no formal
                education? Or that Michael Faraday couldn’t have discovered the principles of electromagnetism because
                he hadn’t attended even a single day of school? Or that Benjamin Franklin couldn’t have invented
                bifocals and discovered the properties of lightning, Shakespeare couldn’t have written thirty-seven of
                the greatest works of English literature, Edison invented the phonograph, Mark Twain written <em>A
                    Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court</em>, or the prophet Mohammed dictated the Quran because
                they lacked a formal education? William McClellan said of Joseph, "He attended my high school during the
                winter of 1834. He attended and learned science all winter. I learned the strength of his mind as to the
                study and principles of science. Hence I think I knew him. And I here say that he had one of the
                strongest, well balanced, penetrating, and retentive minds of any man with whom I ever formed an
                acquaintance, among the thousands of my observation. Although when I took him into my school, he was
                without scientific knowledge or attainments." (De Groote, Deseret News, January 28, 2009).
                <br><br>
                Many
                people have done amazing things and have written great books without the benefit of a formal education.
                Joseph owned a library card, he participated in a debate club, he was an accomplished revival exhorter,
                and his father and wife were both trained school teachers. His brother Hyrum attended Moor's Academy,
                which was a prep school for Dartmouth College, and he disseminated much of his knowledge to young
                Joseph. While it is in the interest of the essay to paint Joseph Smith as an ignorant farmboy, the
                reality is that he was clearly a brilliant person who also carried with him a high amount of charm and
                talent. Book of Mormon apologists, such as those who wrote this essay, who try to paint Joseph Smith as
                an ignoramus in order to make him seem incapable of producing any kind of impressive work do him a great
                injustice. Witnesses to Joseph’s translation method insist that he never referred to outside materials
                while translating. This allows only two conclusions, both of which are problematic to the standard
                narrative: either the witnesses are entirely unreliable, or Joseph was remarkably capable of memorizing
                and recalling large amounts of information. He also sought out and utilized information that was
                available in his environment. A 2017 BYU research project reveals that Joseph Smith plagiarized much of
                his inspired translation of the Bible from Adam Clarke’s Bible Commentary
                (<a href="http://jur.byu.edu/?p=21296">http://jur.byu.edu/?p=21296</a>).
                <br><br>
                Let’s suppose just for a moment that Joseph Smith wasn’t clueless
                at all, but that he was an uncommonly creative young man with a superior intellect and memory and that,
                in addition to his own fertile imagination, he drew upon the Bible, the apocrypha, the stories of the
                Revolutionary War and the War of 1812, the sermons of burned-over district ministers, the popular myths
                of the moundbuilders, the works of local authors like Ethan Smith, and many other sources from his
                immediate environment, works that appear to have left unmistakable fingerprints in the Book of Mormon.
                Even if you don’t believe that Joseph could have written the Book of Mormon, there is absolutely no
                reason to conclude that he was “incapable of writing a book on his own.” <em>If nothing else is
                    accomplished with this commentary, the myth that Joseph Smith was an ignorant farmboy should be
                    dispelled.</em> Joseph had a keen intellect and an impressive ability to think clearly and
                creatively far beyond the obscurity into which correlated church history tries to corner him.
                Personally, I think he was a genius, and he certainly was capable of writing a book given the amount of
                time between the first vision and the release of the Book of Mormon.
            </span>

        <p>
            Joseph’s wife Emma insisted that, at the time of translation, Joseph “could neither write nor dictate a
            coherent and well-worded letter, let alone dictat[e] a book like the Book of Mormon.”<a
                href="/study/manual/gospel-topics-essays/book-of-mormon-translation?lang=eng#note5"><sup>5</sup></a>
            <span style="color: blue;">
                (This quote is from an interview given to her son 50 years later, just before her death, where she also
                insisted that Joseph Smith never participated in polygamy)</span>.
        </p>

        <p> <span style="color: blue;">
                We will address <em>Emma’s comment</em>, but first we should consider one mistake that people often make
                when reading historical documents, which is to confuse spelling and punctuation errors for signs of
                illiteracy. Spelling was far less formalized in frontier America than it is today, and punctuation was
                entirely optional.

                To understand this, all we have to do is look at the grammar and spelling in
                the first draft of the Book of Mormon, penned by Joseph's scribes. Besides having no punctuation, this
                document had thousands of grammatical and spelling errors. (R. Skousen, Grammatical-variation,

                So, rather than taking someone else’s word for it, let’s look at some of Joseph’s own personal writing
                and
                judge for ourselves. Here is an excerpt from a letter that Joseph Smith wrote, in his own hand, to
                Oliver
                Cowdery in 1829, the exact time period when Emma later claimed he was unable to write, let alone dictate
                coherently. I have cleaned up the spelling in a few places and added some punctuation, but I have left
                the
                everything else completely untouched. Judge for yourself whether Joseph Smith could “neither write nor
                dictate a coherent well-worded letter.”
                <br><br>
                “I would inform you that I arrived at home on sunday morning the 4th after having a prosperous Journey,
                and
                found all well. The people are all friendly to us except a few who are in opposition to everything,
                unless
                it is something that is exactly like themselves, and two of our most formidable persecutors are now
                under
                censure and are cited to a trial in the church for crimes which, if true, are worse than all the Gold
                Book
                business. We do not rejoice in the affliction of our enemies, but we shall be glad to have truth
                prevail.
                There begins to be a great call for our books in this country. The minds of the people are very much
                excited
                when they find that there is a copyright obtained, and that there is really book about to be printed…"

                And here is an excerpt from Joseph’s 1832 account of the First Vision, written in his own hand, just a
                couple of years after the publication of the Book of Mormon. I have added punctuation and made some very
                minor spelling corrections:
                <br><br>
                “...I learned in the scriptures that God was the same yesterday, today and forever. that he was no
                respecter
                to persons, for he was God; for I looked upon the sun, the glorious luminary of the earth, and also the
                moon
                rolling in their majesty through the heavens, and also the stars shining in their courses, and the earth
                also upon which I stood, and the beast of the field, and the fowls of heaven, and the fish of the
                waters,
                and also man walking forth upon the face of the earth in majesty and in the strength of beauty, whose
                power
                and intelligence in governing the things which are so exceeding great and marvelous, even in the
                likeness of
                him who created them. And when I considered upon these things my heart exclaimed, “Well hath the wise
                man
                said it is a fool that saith in his heart there is no God!” My heart exclaimed, “All, all these bear
                testimony and bespeak an omnipotent and omnipresent power; a being who maketh laws and decrees, and
                bindeth
                all things in their bounds, who filleth eternity, who was and is and will be, from all Eternity to
                Eternity!” (Joseph Smith Papers, History-October-1829).
                <br><br>
                All indications are that Joseph Smith was a very intelligent, articulate, and surprisingly well-educated
                young man who, although he preferred to use scribes to dictate scriptures (imagine trying to write with
                quill and inkwell while your face is pressed into the brim of a hat, as this essay will later describe),
                he
                was entirely capable of creating competent and powerful prose. And he had pretty good penmanship, too.
                The
                ignoramus farmboy dismissal of Joseph Smith was invented purely to make the Book of Mormon appear that
                much
                more miraculous. It is deceptive at best, and has always been necessary to make the history and story of
                the
                restoration work.

            Joseph received the plates in September 1827 and the following spring, in Harmony, Pennsylvania, began
            translating them in earnest, with Emma and his friend Martin Harris serving as his main scribes. The
            resulting English transcription, known as the Book of Lehi and referred to by Joseph Smith as written on 116
            pages, was subsequently lost or stolen. As a result, Joseph Smith was rebuked by the Lord and lost the
            ability to translate for a short time.<a
                href="/study/manual/gospel-topics-essays/book-of-mormon-translation?lang=eng#note6"><sup>6</sup></a>
            (<span style="color: blue;">Joseph tells us that at this point the angel took the Nephite Interpreters from
                him and they were never returned. This means that the entire Book of Mormon that we have today was
                produced without any help from the device that our Primary teachers called the “Urim and Thummim,” This
                is a huge change from the dominant church narrative, and will be discussed in more detail in the coming
                paragraphs.</span>).
        </p>

        <p>
            Joseph began translating again in 1829, and almost all of the present Book of Mormon text was translated
            during a three-month period between April and June of that year. His chief scribe during these months was <a
                href="http://history.lds.org/article/doctrine-and-covenants-oliver-cowdery">Oliver
                Cowdery</a>, a schoolteacher from Vermont who learned about the Book of Mormon while boarding with
            Joseph’s parents in Palmyra. Called by God in a vision, Cowdery traveled to Harmony to meet Joseph Smith and
            investigate further. Of his experience as scribe, Cowdery wrote, “These were days never to be forgotten—to
            sit under the sound of a voice dictated by the <em>inspiration</em> of heaven.”<a
                href="/study/manual/gospel-topics-essays/book-of-mormon-translation?lang=eng#note7"><sup>7</sup></a>

            (<span style="color: blue;">It should be noted that Oliver Cowdery’s original connection with Joseph’s
                family might have been through treasure hunting and folk magic going back to the Smiths’ time in
                Vermont. Oliver’s treasure seeking specialty was the use of dowsing rods, which is noted in official
                church history. (Oliver Cowdery’s Gift, History.LDS.Org)</span>).
        </p>

        <p>
            The manuscript that Joseph Smith dictated to Oliver Cowdery and others is known today as the original
            manuscript, about 28 percent of which still survives.<a
                href="/study/manual/gospel-topics-essays/book-of-mormon-translation?lang=eng#note8"><sup>8</sup></a>
            This manuscript corroborates Joseph Smith’s
            statements that the manuscript was written within a short time frame and that it was dictated from another
            language. For example, it includes errors that suggest the scribe heard words incorrectly rather than
            misread words copied from another manuscript.<a
                href="/study/manual/gospel-topics-essays/book-of-mormon-translation?lang=eng#note9"><sup>9</sup></a>

            (<span style="color: blue;">I don’t think there is any argument that the scribes might not have heard
                Joseph’s dictation with perfect
                accuracy. The Isaiah portions that were received by revelation also contain the errors of the 17th
                century
                translators of the King James Bible</span>).
        </p>

        <p>
            <span style="color: blue;">
                The translation time frame is another area that is greatly misunderstood and inaccurately reported. We
                are
                told that Joseph produced the Book of Mormon in just 90 days. Even so, the amount of material in the
                Book of
                Mormon could be dictated over that period of time at a rate of just 45 minutes per day, assuming Joseph
                already knew what he wanted to say, but we know he spent a great deal more time than that. Martin Harris
                tells us that on a typical day Joseph would dictate in the morning and then take a long walk by himself
                along the river or in the woods, after which he would return ready to dictate again. That leaves open
                the
                distinct possibility that he spent more time preparing than actually dictating.
                <br><br>
                In addition, Joseph had in essence a do-over when the 116 pages were lost. Seven or eight months passed
                between the acquisition of the plates and the recording the book of Lehi. When Joseph dictated the story
                the
                second time in Nephi 1 and 2 he was just telling the same story again. Another eight months passed
                before
                Oliver Cowdery showed up and the famous 90-day translation actually began. Joseph could have spent that
                time
                refining the story in his head. But there was over a year and a half before that when Joseph was
                translating
                off and on, and possibly developing the story that he would later dictate to Oliver. So now we’re
                looking at
                a couple of years to develop the narrative. But wait, there’s more. Joseph’s mother tells us that a
                favorite
                pastime of the Smith family was to sit around the fire while young Joseph told them amazing tales of the
                ancient inhabitants of the Americas. “He would describe the ancient inhabitants of this continent, their
                dress, mode of travelings, and the animals upon which they rode; their cities, their buildings, with
                every
                particular; their mode of warfare; and also their religious worship. This he would do with as much ease,
                seemingly, as if he had spent his whole life among them.( Lucy Mack Smith, Biographical Sketches of
                Joseph
                Smith the Prophet, and His Progenitors for Many Generations). In other words, Joseph had been thinking
                about
                the Book of Mormon story for many years before the Gold Plates even entered the picture, and he was
                expert
                at producing impressive stories about the ancient Americans out of thin air. Then, once the Gold Plates
                story emerged, six years passed between the first Moroni visit and the final translation, of which the
                90-day period was just the culmination.
                <br><br>
                But is Joseph Smith entirely unique in producing a book that people assumed to be beyond his capacity?
                It
                turns out that he is not. Many others have produced books that appear to be miraculous. Let’s consider
                just
                a few examples from roughly the same time period as the Book of Mormon:
                <br><br>
                Philemon Stewart was a member of the United Society of Believers in Christ's Second Appearing, a
                religious
                community commonly known as the Shakers. He produced the sacred text known as The Sacred Roll and Book,
                which he claims was dictated to him by an angel of God, and of which Martin Harris was also a witness to
                both the book and the angel. Part 1 of the shakers’ sacred scroll is over 400 pages long and was
                dictated in
                just 14 days, which is impressive even when compared to the 90-day claim for the Book of Mormon. Stewart
                disavowed all 'natural wisdom' and maintained that he 'knew naught of the subject' until it was 'opened
                and
                brought forward, word after word, by the mighty Angel.' (Stein, Inspiration, revelation, and scripture:
                The
                story of a Shaker Bible, Proceedings of the American Antiquarian Society (Vol. 105, No. 2, p. 347).
                There is
                no question that Stewart produced an extremely impressive piece of work, especially considering that it
                was
                dictated in public, before witnesses, in just two weeks without any kind of notes.
                <br><br>
                In the early 1900s a poorly educated and otherwise unimpressive housewife named Pearl Curran suddenly
                began
                writing lengthy novels and poems without any previous writing experience, which she claimed were
                dictated to
                her by the spirit of a 17th century woman named Patience Worth. Curran would dictate lengthy and
                impressive
                novels easily, without notes, often for hours on end in front of audiences of marvelling onlookers. The
                renowned poet Edgar Lee Masters observed, “There is no doubt...she is producing remarkable literature.”
                The
                prestigious Braithwaite anthology listed five of her poems among the nation’s best published in 1917,
                and
                the New York Times hailed her first novel as a true “feat of literary composition.” She produced seven
                impressive novels, volumes of poetry, short stories, and plays that added up to nearly four million
                words
                (Diliberto, Smithsonian Magazine, September, 2010). Curran seemed to be able to write detailed histories
                of
                periods long before her time, with dialects and vocabulary that she had supposedly never heard, and
                descriptions of places she had never been. Besides being so mind bogglingly prolific, Curran created
                literature that was extremely popular at the time and garnered wide acclaim from critics, which cannot
                be
                said about the Book of Mormon.

                James Strang was an early Mormon convert who claimed to have been appointed as Joseph Smith’s successor.
                Most members of the modern LDS church might be surprised to learn that upon Joseph’s death a large
                contingent of the church, numbering in the thousands, followed Strang rather than Brigham Young. These
                included those saints who did not want to participate in polygamy and those who still desired to follow
                a
                prophet, a calling to which Brigham initially made no claims. Strang, on the other hand, declared that
                he
                communed with angels, including Moroni, who showed him the location of buried ancient metal plates.
                Among
                those who followed Strang were Emma Smith and her children, Joseph’s Mother Lucy, Joseph’s only living
                brother William, all of the living members of the eight witnesses, and the Three Witnesses except for
                Oliver
                Cowdery, who moved near to the Strangite community but never officially joined. Like Joseph Smith,
                Strang
                had eleven eyewitnesses of his plates. Unlike Joseph, it was the witnesses who were told where to find
                the
                plates and who dug them up themselves. Also unlike Joseph, the plates remained in the community for
                decades
                until they were supposedly borrowed by the Salt Lake LDS church for examination but never returned.
                Although
                he had only a grade school education Strang translated the contents of two sets of plates by the “gift
                and
                power of God” and produced the Voree Record and The Book of the Law of the Lord. The resulting texts
                contain
                many of the same Hebraisms that we find in the Book of Mormon (http://www.strangite.org/Chiasmus.htm).

                Joseph’s own mother, Lucy Mack Smith, is another excellent example. Despite having no formal education,
                but
                having access to the exact same resources of her son, Lucy wrote a very intelligent and complex 500-page
                book, which she produced by dictating to a scribe. According to this essay’s own criteria Lucy was also
                “incapable of writing a book.”

            In addition, some grammatical constructions that
            are more characteristic of Near Eastern languages than English appear in the original manuscript, suggesting
            that the base language of the translation was not English.<a

            (Occam's Razor would tell us that the author was carefully choosing his words to sound as much like the King
            James Bible as possible, which carried more credibility to being a work of God. Otherwise, why would an
            ancient Mayan text intended for a 19th century American audience be translated by the “gift and power of
            God” into 17th century King James English, rather than 19th century American English?).
