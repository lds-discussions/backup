        <h2>Annotated Analysis of the Official LDS Essay on the Book of Mormon Translation</h2>

        <p>
            The following is an annotated version of the official LDS-released essay titled "Book of Mormon
            Translation." This essay was published by the Church to provide an explanation of how the Book of Mormon was
            translated, addressing the discrepancies between the true translation process and the official Church
            narrative that has been taught since its founding. In this annotated version, all original text from the
            Church essay is presented in <span style="color: #0000CD;">blue</span>, while our commentary and analysis
            appear in black. The official essay can
            be accessed directly on the <a
                href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics-essays/book-of-mormon-translation?lang=eng">LDS
                website</a>.
            This annotated essay is based on material from ongoing research, which is regularly updated. You can access
            the original, continuously updated source by clicking <a
                href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jv0pFvNgATTjwWiKmG8TVeY4m2qADI3A4MwXtLW3dkM/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.3tcjwzhz7gy2">[here]</a>.
            <br><br>
            Historically, many Church leaders have labeled inquiries into topics like those discussed in this essay as
            "anti-Mormon." In some cases, members have been excommunicated for their research into Church history.
            However, with the rise of the internet, many of these historical issues have been brought to light,
            prompting the Church to address them. Despite this, significant concerns remain about the translation of the
            Book of Mormon, and some of the Church's responses have been criticized for being evasive or dismissive of
            the deeper issues.
            <br><br>
            This annotated essay is lengthy, but it is crucial to include all of the material presented here. Much of
            this information is unfamiliar to many Church members, and our additional notes offer insights that are new
            to almost all members. Understanding the true translation process of the Book of Mormon is essential,
            especially as it relates to the translation of the Book of Abraham and Joseph Smith's use of Adam Clarke's
            biblical commentaries in his Bible translation. These revelations raise serious questions about the accuracy
            of the scriptures Joseph Smith produced, which in turn brings into question his reliability as a prophet. As
            prominent LDS historian Richard Bushman <a
                href="https://medium.com/@jellistx/transcript-of-claudia-and-richard-bushmans-remarks-at-faith-again-e9d03bdea0e3">stated</a>,
            "<em>I think that for the Church to remain strong, it has to
                reconstruct its narrative. <strong>The dominant narrative is not true; it can’t be sustained</strong>.
                The
                Church has to
                absorb all this new information, or it will be on very shaky grounds, and that’s what it is trying to
                do. It
                will be a strain for a lot of people, older people especially. But I think it has to change.</em>"
            <br><br>
            As President George Albert Smith once remarked, “<em>If a faith will not bear to be investigated; if its
                preachers and professors are afraid to have it examined, their foundation must be very weak.</em>”
            (Journal of
            Discourses, Volume 14, Page 216)

                The Book of

                forth
                of the English text of the Book of Mormon through a careful study of statements made by Joseph Smith,
                his

        <h3><span class="essay-text">“By the Gift and Power of God”</span></h3>

        <p> <span class="essay-text">
                Joseph Smith reported that on the evening of September 21, 1823, while he prayed in the upper room of
                his
                parents’ small log home in Palmyra, New York, an angel who called himself Moroni appeared and told
                Joseph
                that
                <em>“God had a work for [you] to do.”</em><a

                He informed Joseph that “there was a book deposited, written upon gold
                plates, giving an account of the former inhabitants of this continent, and the source from whence they
                sprang.”
                The book could be found in a hill not far from the Smith family farm. This was no ordinary history, for
                it
                contained <em>“the fullness of the everlasting Gospel as delivered by the Savior.”</em><a

            </span>
        <p>
            To fully grasp the significance of the September 21st date, and the major revelation this essay will
            soon
            present about the instrument used to translate the Book of Mormon, it's essential to first examine some
            key
            activities of Joseph Smith and his family before the Gold Plates came into play. While this may seem
            like a
            detour from the essay, it's crucial for gaining an accurate perspective.
            <br><br>
            First, it’s important to understand that the early history and timeline of the Church are not exactly as
            they are taught in lesson manuals or even in Joseph Smith’s History in the Pearl of Great Price. Church
            historians are beginning to acknowledge this discrepancy. Richard Bushman and other LDS scholars have
            accepted that, before Joseph Smith spoke of visitations from God, Jesus, and the angel Moroni, he
            participated in magical ceremonies aimed at persuading guardian spirits to reveal the locations of
            buried
            treasures. Bushman suggests that God may have used folk magic as a kind of preparatory phase for
            Joseph’s
            later spiritual calling (Rough Stone Rolling).
            <br><br>
            The date on which Joseph went to the hill to retrieve the plates—September 21—is highly significant in
            the
            context of folk magic and occult practices. It falls on the Autumnal Equinox, a time when, according to
            magical belief, the spirits of the dead are more accessible to mortals and more easily convinced to
            disclose
            the locations of buried treasures. This idea is rooted in the writings of occult figures like Heinrich
            Cornelius Agrippa, whose works were influential in early 19th-century America. More importantly,
            September
            21 is the specific date encoded in magic parchments owned by the Smith family, which they used to
            determine
            the optimal times for their treasure-hunting expeditions.

        </figure>

        <p>
            It comes as something of a surprise to most Latter-Day Saints that the Smith family owned and used these
            magic parchments, along with a ceremonial dagger and other occult paraphernalia, to perform their
            mystical
            activities. Joseph’s mother, Lucy Mack Smith, described their progression from casual to intensive
            magical
            pursuits thus: “we stopt our labor and went at trying to win the faculty of Abrac drawing magic circles
            or
            sooth saying to the neglect of all kind of business.” (Joseph Smith Papers, Lucy Mack Smith, History,
            1844–1845). The “Abrac” to which Lucy refers is the magical practice of attempting to gain control over
            supernatural beings in the pursuit of material wealth through magical ceremonies. This typically
            involved
            two processes. First was the use of either a rodsman, who used a dowsing rod to divine the location of
            treasure (Oliver Cowdery did this), or a seer who located it by “glass-looking” into stone or glass
            object.
            Second was a ceremony to appease the guardian ghost by drawing a magical circle on the ground, marking
            it
            with occult symbols drawn with a ceremonial dagger, and sometimes performing an animal sacrifice before
            attempting to dig. The word Abrac, which Lucy uses, comes from the name of the demon Abraxas, who is
            associated with occult numerology and whose name is the source of the magical word “abracadabra” (Brown,
            S.
            M. Reconsidering Lucy Mack Smith’s Folk Magic Confession. Mormon Historical Studies).
            <br><br>
            Some of theSmith’s customers tell us that animals were indeed sacrificed on such occasions. One of the
            Smiths’ clients
            described it this way: “That a black sheep should be taken to the ground where the treasures were
            concealed
            – that after cutting its throat, it should be led around in a circle while bleeding. This being done,
            the
            wrath of the evil spirit would be appeased.” (Early Mormon Documents, Vol. 2, pp.59-61). LDS scholar M.
            Wilford Poulson assures us that the animals were obtained honorably. He says that Wallace Miner reported
            "I
            once asked Stafford if Smith did steal a sheep from him. He said no, not exactly. He said, he did miss a
            black sheep, but soon Joseph came and admitted he took it for sacrifice but he was willing to work for

            The Smiths’ magical documents are named by historians
            according to the writing that appears on each of them: the “Jehovah, Jehovah, Jehovah” parchment, the
            “Peter
            Bind Them” parchment, and the “Holiness to the Lord” parchment, from which Joseph Smith likely derived
            the
            declaration that now appears above the doors of LDS temples. The magic symbols on these documents were
            copied directly from occult texts, including The Magus by Francis Barrett, the New and Complete
            Illustration
            of Celestial Sciences by Ebenezer Sibly, and The Discoverie of Witchcraft by Reginald Scot.

            <br><br>
            The date of September 21-22 is defined
            in these magical texts as the proper time to summon a treasure-guarding ghost. Joseph Smith’s
            interaction on
            21-22 September 1823 with the spirit who we now know as Angel Moroni fits the internal dating of his
            family's magic parchment. This personage was not given a name in the earliest references but was called
            Nephi in the official Joseph Smith Testimony for forty years until 1878 when it was edited for
            consistency
            and his name was changed to Moroni (Times and Seasons Vol. III pp. 749, 753, Millennial Star, vol. 3,
            p.53,
            Pearl of Great Price, 1851 edition, page 41). The date and time of Joseph’s September 1823 visitation
            complied with the instructions for spirit summoning incantations recorded by Scot, Agrippa, Sibly,
            Barrett
            and other occult writers (D. M. Quinn, Early Mormonism and the Magic World View, Chs. 1-4). Moroni/Nephi
            first appeared to Joseph on the night of the Autumnal equinox, between midnight and dawn, which was a
            date
            prescribed in the magical books for such encounters. Having failed to retrieve the plates on his first
            attempt, Joseph continued to visit the hill annually on the same date. He finally succeeded in obtaining
            the
            plates on the eve of the equinox in 1827, in the first hour after midnight. Witness accounts tell us
            that he
            finally found the correct magical prescription for success, which required him to arrive on that date
            and
            time, to bring a companion, in this case Emma, to dress in black clothing, and to ride a black horse,
            which
            he borrowed from Joseph Knight (Marquardt, Inventing Mormonism: Tradition and the Historical Record, Ch.
            5).

        <p>
            The authors of this essay want to set the stage early on that Joseph was incapable of writing a book
            without even giving him the benefit of the doubt. <em>I think it is fair to say that there is a vast gap
                between being uneducated and being stupid.</em> Should we conclude that Abraham Lincoln could not
            have become president of the United States or written the Gettysburg Address because he had no formal
            education? Or that Michael Faraday couldn’t have discovered the principles of electromagnetism because
            he hadn’t attended even a single day of school? Or that Benjamin Franklin couldn’t have invented
            bifocals and discovered the properties of lightning, Shakespeare couldn’t have written thirty-seven of
            the greatest works of English literature, Edison invented the phonograph, Mark Twain written <em>A
                Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court</em>, or the prophet Mohammed dictated the Quran because
            they lacked a formal education? William McClellan said of Joseph, "He attended my high school during the
            winter of 1834. He attended and learned science all winter. I learned the strength of his mind as to the
            study and principles of science. Hence I think I knew him. And I here say that he had one of the
            strongest, well balanced, penetrating, and retentive minds of any man with whom I ever formed an
            acquaintance, among the thousands of my observation. Although when I took him into my school, he was
            without scientific knowledge or attainments." (De Groote, Deseret News, January 28, 2009).
            <br><br>
            Many
            people have done amazing things and have written great books without the benefit of a formal education.
            Joseph owned a library card, he participated in a debate club, he was an accomplished revival exhorter,
            and his father and wife were both trained school teachers. His brother Hyrum attended Moor's Academy,
            which was a prep school for Dartmouth College, and he disseminated much of his knowledge to young
            Joseph. While it is in the interest of the essay to paint Joseph Smith as an ignorant farmboy, the
            reality is that he was clearly a brilliant person who also carried with him a high amount of charm and
            talent. Book of Mormon apologists, such as those who wrote this essay, who try to paint Joseph Smith as
            an ignoramus in order to make him seem incapable of producing any kind of impressive work do him a great
            injustice. Witnesses to Joseph’s translation method insist that he never referred to outside materials
            while translating. This allows only two conclusions, both of which are problematic to the standard
            narrative: either the witnesses are entirely unreliable, or Joseph was remarkably capable of memorizing
            and recalling large amounts of information. He also sought out and utilized information that was
            available in his environment. A 2017 BYU research project reveals that Joseph Smith plagiarized much of
            his inspired translation of the Bible from Adam Clarke’s Bible Commentary
            (<a href="http://jur.byu.edu/?p=21296">http://jur.byu.edu/?p=21296</a>).
            <br><br>
            Let’s suppose just for a moment that Joseph Smith wasn’t clueless
            at all, but that he was an uncommonly creative young man with a superior intellect and memory and that,
            in addition to his own fertile imagination, he drew upon the Bible, the apocrypha, the stories of the
            Revolutionary War and the War of 1812, the sermons of burned-over district ministers, the popular myths
            of the moundbuilders, the works of local authors like Ethan Smith, and many other sources from his
            immediate environment, works that appear to have left unmistakable fingerprints in the Book of Mormon.
            Even if you don’t believe that Joseph could have written the Book of Mormon, there is absolutely no
            reason to conclude that he was “incapable of writing a book on his own.” <em>If nothing else is
                accomplished with this commentary, the myth that Joseph Smith was an ignorant farmboy should be
                dispelled.</em> Joseph had a keen intellect and an impressive ability to think clearly and
            creatively far beyond the obscurity into which correlated church history tries to corner him.
            Personally, I think he was a genius, and he certainly was capable of writing a book given the amount of
            time between the first vision and the release of the Book of Mormon.

                Joseph’s wife Emma insisted that, at the time of translation, Joseph “could neither write nor dictate a
                coherent and well-worded letter, let alone dictat[e] a book like the Book of Mormon.”<a

            (This quote is from an interview given to her son 50 years later, just before her death, where she also
            insisted that Joseph Smith never participated in polygamy)

        <p>
            We will address <em>Emma’s comment</em>, but first we should consider one mistake that people often make
            when reading historical documents, which is to confuse spelling and punctuation errors for signs of
            illiteracy. Spelling was far less formalized in frontier America than it is today, and punctuation was
            entirely optional.
            <br><br>
            To understand this, all we have to do is look at the grammar and spelling in
            the first draft of the Book of Mormon, penned by Joseph's scribes. Besides having no punctuation, this
            document had thousands of grammatical and spelling errors. (R. Skousen, Grammatical-variation,

            So, rather than taking someone else’s word for it, let’s look at some of Joseph’s own personal writing
            and
            judge for ourselves. Here is an excerpt from a letter that Joseph Smith wrote, in his own hand, to
            Oliver
            Cowdery in 1829, the exact time period when Emma later claimed he was unable to write, let alone dictate
            coherently. I have cleaned up the spelling in a few places and added some punctuation, but I have left
            the
            everything else completely untouched. Judge for yourself whether Joseph Smith could “neither write nor
            dictate a coherent well-worded letter.”
            <br><br>
            “I would inform you that I arrived at home on sunday morning the 4th after having a prosperous Journey,
            and
            found all well. The people are all friendly to us except a few who are in opposition to everything,
            unless
            it is something that is exactly like themselves, and two of our most formidable persecutors are now
            under
            censure and are cited to a trial in the church for crimes which, if true, are worse than all the Gold
            Book
            business. We do not rejoice in the affliction of our enemies, but we shall be glad to have truth
            prevail.
            There begins to be a great call for our books in this country. The minds of the people are very much
            excited
            when they find that there is a copyright obtained, and that there is really book about to be printed…"

            And here is an excerpt from Joseph’s 1832 account of the First Vision, written in his own hand, just a
            couple of years after the publication of the Book of Mormon. I have added punctuation and made some very
            minor spelling corrections:
            <br><br>
            “...I learned in the scriptures that God was the same yesterday, today and forever. that he was no
            respecter
            to persons, for he was God; for I looked upon the sun, the glorious luminary of the earth, and also the
            moon
            rolling in their majesty through the heavens, and also the stars shining in their courses, and the earth
            also upon which I stood, and the beast of the field, and the fowls of heaven, and the fish of the
            waters,
            and also man walking forth upon the face of the earth in majesty and in the strength of beauty, whose
            power
            and intelligence in governing the things which are so exceeding great and marvelous, even in the
            likeness of
            him who created them. And when I considered upon these things my heart exclaimed, “Well hath the wise
            man
            said it is a fool that saith in his heart there is no God!” My heart exclaimed, “All, all these bear
            testimony and bespeak an omnipotent and omnipresent power; a being who maketh laws and decrees, and
            bindeth
            all things in their bounds, who filleth eternity, who was and is and will be, from all Eternity to
            Eternity!” (Joseph Smith Papers, History-October-1829).
            <br><br>
            All indications are that Joseph Smith was a very intelligent, articulate, and surprisingly well-educated
            young man who, although he preferred to use scribes to dictate scriptures (imagine trying to write with
            quill and inkwell while your face is pressed into the brim of a hat, as this essay will later describe),
            he
            was entirely capable of creating competent and powerful prose. And he had pretty good penmanship, too.
            The
            ignoramus farmboy dismissal of Joseph Smith was invented purely to make the Book of Mormon appear that
            much
            more miraculous. It is deceptive at best, and has always been necessary to make the history and story of
            the
            restoration work.

                Joseph received the plates in September 1827 and the following spring, in Harmony, Pennsylvania, began
                translating them in earnest, with Emma and his friend Martin Harris serving as his main scribes. The
                resulting English transcription, known as the Book of Lehi and referred to by Joseph Smith as written on
                116
                pages, was subsequently lost or stolen. As a result, Joseph Smith was rebuked by the Lord and lost the

                Joseph began translating again in 1829, and almost all of the present Book of Mormon text was translated
                during a three-month period between April and June of that year. His chief scribe during these months
                was <a href="http://history.lds.org/article/doctrine-and-covenants-oliver-cowdery">Oliver
                    Cowdery</a>, a schoolteacher from Vermont who learned about the Book of Mormon while boarding with
                Joseph’s parents in Palmyra. Called by God in a vision, Cowdery traveled to Harmony to meet Joseph Smith
                and
                investigate further. Of his experience as scribe, Cowdery wrote, “These were days never to be
                forgotten—to
                sit under the sound of a voice dictated by the <em>inspiration</em> of heaven.”<a

            (It should be noted that Oliver Cowdery’s original connection with Joseph’s
            family might have been through treasure hunting and folk magic going back to the Smiths’ time in
            Vermont. Oliver’s treasure seeking specialty was the use of dowsing rods, which is noted in official
            church history. (Oliver Cowdery’s Gift, History.LDS.Org)).

                The manuscript that Joseph Smith dictated to Oliver Cowdery and others is known today as the original
                manuscript, about 28 percent of which still survives.<a
                    href="/study/manual/gospel-topics-essays/book-of-mormon-translation?lang=eng#note8"><sup>8</sup></a>
                This manuscript corroborates Joseph Smith’s
                statements that the manuscript was written within a short time frame and that it was dictated from
                another
                language. For example, it includes errors that suggest the scribe heard words incorrectly rather than
                misread words copied from another manuscript.<a

            (I don’t think there is any argument that the scribes might not have heard
            Joseph’s dictation with perfect
            accuracy. The Isaiah portions that were received by revelation also contain the errors of the 17th
            century
            translators of the King James Bible).
        </p>

        <p>
            The translation time frame is another area that is greatly misunderstood and inaccurately reported. We
            are
            told that Joseph produced the Book of Mormon in just 90 days. Even so, the amount of material in the
            Book of
            Mormon could be dictated over that period of time at a rate of just 45 minutes per day, assuming Joseph
            already knew what he wanted to say, but we know he spent a great deal more time than that. Martin Harris
            tells us that on a typical day Joseph would dictate in the morning and then take a long walk by himself
            along the river or in the woods, after which he would return ready to dictate again. That leaves open
            the
            distinct possibility that he spent more time preparing than actually dictating.
            <br><br>
            In addition, Joseph had in essence a do-over when the 116 pages were lost. Seven or eight months passed
            between the acquisition of the plates and the recording the book of Lehi. When Joseph dictated the story
            the
            second time in Nephi 1 and 2 he was just telling the same story again. Another eight months passed
            before
            Oliver Cowdery showed up and the famous 90-day translation actually began. Joseph could have spent that
            time
            refining the story in his head. But there was over a year and a half before that when Joseph was
            translating
            off and on, and possibly developing the story that he would later dictate to Oliver. So now we’re
            looking at
            a couple of years to develop the narrative. But wait, there’s more. Joseph’s mother tells us that a
            favorite
            pastime of the Smith family was to sit around the fire while young Joseph told them amazing tales of the
            ancient inhabitants of the Americas. “He would describe the ancient inhabitants of this continent, their
            dress, mode of travelings, and the animals upon which they rode; their cities, their buildings, with
            every
            particular; their mode of warfare; and also their religious worship. This he would do with as much ease,
            seemingly, as if he had spent his whole life among them.( Lucy Mack Smith, Biographical Sketches of
            Joseph
            Smith the Prophet, and His Progenitors for Many Generations). In other words, Joseph had been thinking
            about
            the Book of Mormon story for many years before the Gold Plates even entered the picture, and he was
            expert
            at producing impressive stories about the ancient Americans out of thin air. Then, once the Gold Plates
            story emerged, six years passed between the first Moroni visit and the final translation, of which the
            90-day period was just the culmination.
            <br><br>
            But is Joseph Smith entirely unique in producing a book that people assumed to be beyond his capacity?
            It
            turns out that he is not. Many others have produced books that appear to be miraculous. Let’s consider
            just
            a few examples from roughly the same time period as the Book of Mormon:
            <br><br>
            Philemon Stewart was a member of the United Society of Believers in Christ's Second Appearing, a
            religious
            community commonly known as the Shakers. He produced the sacred text known as The Sacred Roll and Book,
            which he claims was dictated to him by an angel of God, and of which Martin Harris was also a witness to
            both the book and the angel. Part 1 of the shakers’ sacred scroll is over 400 pages long and was
            dictated in
            just 14 days, which is impressive even when compared to the 90-day claim for the Book of Mormon. Stewart
            disavowed all 'natural wisdom' and maintained that he 'knew naught of the subject' until it was 'opened
            and
            brought forward, word after word, by the mighty Angel.' (Stein, Inspiration, revelation, and scripture:
            The
            story of a Shaker Bible, Proceedings of the American Antiquarian Society (Vol. 105, No. 2, p. 347)).
            There is
            no question that Stewart produced an extremely impressive piece of work, especially considering that it
            was
            dictated in public, before witnesses, in just two weeks without any kind of notes.
            <br><br>
            In the early 1900s a poorly educated and otherwise unimpressive housewife named Pearl Curran suddenly
            began
            writing lengthy novels and poems without any previous writing experience, which she claimed were
            dictated to
            her by the spirit of a 17th century woman named Patience Worth. Curran would dictate lengthy and
            impressive
            novels easily, without notes, often for hours on end in front of audiences of marvelling onlookers. The
            renowned poet Edgar Lee Masters observed, “There is no doubt...she is producing remarkable literature.”
            The
            prestigious Braithwaite anthology listed five of her poems among the nation’s best published in 1917,
            and
            the New York Times hailed her first novel as a true “feat of literary composition.” She produced seven
            impressive novels, volumes of poetry, short stories, and plays that added up to nearly four million
            words
            (Diliberto, Smithsonian Magazine, September, 2010). Curran seemed to be able to write detailed histories
            of
            periods long before her time, with dialects and vocabulary that she had supposedly never heard, and
            descriptions of places she had never been. Besides being so mind bogglingly prolific, Curran created
            literature that was extremely popular at the time and garnered wide acclaim from critics, which cannot
            be
            said about the Book of Mormon.

            James Strang was an early Mormon convert who claimed to have been appointed as Joseph Smith’s successor.
            Most members of the modern LDS church might be surprised to learn that upon Joseph’s death a large
            contingent of the church, numbering in the thousands, followed Strang rather than Brigham Young. These
            included those saints who did not want to participate in polygamy and those who still desired to follow
            a
            prophet, a calling to which Brigham initially made no claims. Strang, on the other hand, declared that
            he
            communed with angels, including Moroni, who showed him the location of buried ancient metal plates.
            Among
            those who followed Strang were Emma Smith and her children, Joseph’s Mother Lucy, Joseph’s only living
            brother William, all of the living members of the eight witnesses, and the Three Witnesses except for
            Oliver
            Cowdery, who moved near to the Strangite community but never officially joined. Like Joseph Smith,
            Strang
            had eleven eyewitnesses of his plates. Unlike Joseph, it was the witnesses who were told where to find
            the
            plates and who dug them up themselves. Also unlike Joseph, the plates remained in the community for
            decades
            until they were supposedly borrowed by the Salt Lake LDS church for examination but never returned.
            Although
            he had only a grade school education Strang translated the contents of two sets of plates by the “gift
            and
            power of God” and produced the Voree Record and The Book of the Law of the Lord. The resulting texts
            contain
            many of the same Hebraisms that we find in the Book of Mormon (http://www.strangite.org/Chiasmus.htm).
            <br><br>
            Joseph’s own mother, Lucy Mack Smith, is another excellent example. Despite having no formal education,
            but
            having access to the exact same resources of her son, Lucy wrote a very intelligent and complex 500-page
            book, which she produced by dictating to a scribe. According to this essay’s own criteria Lucy was also
            “incapable of writing a book.”

            Most, if not all, Book of Mormon “Hebraisms” as well as some of the book’s themes and plot points, can also
            be found in The Late War Between the United States and Great Britain, a grade school textbook that was
            popular in New York at the time Joseph was attending school, and which was also written in the King James
            Bible language. (Grunder, History and Analysis of The Late War, Mormon Parallels: A Bibliographic Source).

            The Urim and Thummim in the Bible are not spectacles. They appear to be more like a pair of dice that

            fault is in me or my son Jonathan, respond with Urim, but if the men of Israel are at fault, respond with
            Thummim” (Samuel 14:41). Heads Urim, tales Thummim. Old Testament scholar Cornelius Van Dam describes it
            this way: “In order to receive the revelation, the high priest took the diamonds [diamond dice engraved with
            names, i.e. the Urim and Thummim] and cast on a table or preferably the ark. From the way they were arranged
            after being cast, the high priest could deduce the answer according to traditional rules known to the high

                Joseph Smith stands out among God’s prophets, because he was called to render into his own language an
                entire volume of scripture amounting to more than 500 printed pages, containing doctrine that would
                deepen
                and expand the theological understanding of millions of people. For this monumental task, God prepared
                additional, practical help in the form of physical instruments.

            <em>This is a common misstatement about the Book of Mormon.</em> The book actually contains no original
            doctrine specific to Mormonism, and none of the doctrines commonly associated with it—such as the priesthood
            (except what is borrowed from the Book of Hebrews), eternal marriage, temple ordinances, tithing,
            preexistence, the Word of Wisdom, degrees of glory, eternal progression, baptism for the dead, the laying on
            of hands, sealings, anointings, garments, or three degrees of glory—are present. None.

            The Book of Mormon also does not describe the Godhead as three distinct beings. In fact, it is more
            Trinitarian than the Bible, especially when examining the first edition before changes were made to soften
            the explicitly Trinitarian language. For example, the description of Mary was altered from the "mother of
            God" to the "mother of the son of God" (<em>1 Nephi 11:18</em>, 1837 Edition), and Jesus was changed from
            "the Lamb of God, even the Eternal Father" to "the Lamb of God, even the Son of the Eternal Father" (<em>1
                Nephi 11:21</em>, 1837 Edition).

            It has been observed that if you created a religion based solely on the contents of the Book of Mormon, you
            would end up with something very much like 19th-century Methodism, the religion Joseph Smith was most
            familiar with. When reading the Book of Mormon, take note of any hints of distinct Mormonism in it.

            An interesting point to consider: draw a diagram of the entire Plan of Salvation using only information from
            the Book of Mormon. Hint: it will look something like this: Earth → Final Judgment → Heaven or Fiery Hell.

                Joseph Smith and his scribes wrote of two instruments used in translating the Book of Mormon. According
                to

                The other instrument, which Joseph Smith discovered in the ground years before he retrieved the gold

            This is the major revelation of this essay, which had previously been dismissed as an <em>"anti-Mormon"</em>
            lie. For years, those who spoke about the seer stone were criticized, but this essay needed to be
            written to explain why the complete history of the translation contradicts the narrative the Church has
            cultivated for so long.
            <br><br>
            It may be unsettling for some members to learn that not a single word of the Book of Mormon was revealed
            through the instrument we were taught to call the “Urim and Thummim.” Instead, every word came from a stone
            that Joseph found in a well. He used it by placing the stone in a hat and pressing his face to the brim,
            <strong>never actually using the gold plates in the process</strong>. This is the true translation method,
            which has been
            actively suppressed by the Church until the internet brought more attention to Joseph Smith's real history.
            <br><br>
            Church leaders claim that they have never tried to hide history. However, the seer stone and the actual
            translation method have been mentioned only a handful of times in Church publications, such as in a <em>1977
                Ensign</em> article ("By the Gift and Power of God," September 1977), published 40 years before this
            essay. The true test of their transparency is to ask yourself: <em>What were you taught in Primary and
                Sunday School? What did you see in <strong>official</strong> Church artwork? What do missionaries tell
                investigators with
                no prior knowledge of Church history?</em> Why would missionaries present a story about the translation
            that this essay now contradicts entirely? How does that align with the Church's own definition of honesty in
            the <a href="https://www.lds.org/manual/gospel-principles/chapter-31-honesty?lang=eng"><em>Gospel
                    Principles</em></a> manual?
            <br><br>
            People have been disciplined by the Church for writing about the actual translation method—this was one of
            the reasons historian D. Michael Quinn was excommunicated. It wasn’t until Google made this "anti-Mormon"
            information about Joseph’s seer stone so unavoidable and undeniable that Church leaders had to revise their
            approach to the Book of Mormon translation. These new admissions are part of what Church leaders refer to as
            <a
                href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2004/04/news-of-the-church/youth-need-inoculation-against-the-world?lang=eng#title1">
                "inoculation"</a>.
            <br><br>
            Many LDS members, myself included, were shocked to learn that the version of Mormon history their friends
            and family members had seen in the <em>South Park</em> cartoon, where Joseph stares into a rock in a hat,
            was actually more accurate than what we were taught in Primary and Sunday School. How could <em>South
                Park</em> present a more accurate depiction of Joseph Smith's translation process than the Church
            itself?
            <br><br>
            I personally ignored this episode for over a decade, believing it was full of anti-Mormon lies. However,
            upon finally watching it, I realized that while it takes jabs at the process, the portrayal of the
            translation itself is more accurate than the missionary discussions I received decades earlier.

            <em>Unable to deflect the inevitable any longer</em>, the Church released this essay, followed by the
            statement: “The stone Joseph Smith used in the Book of Mormon translation effort was often referred to as a
            chocolate-colored stone with an oval shape. This stone passed from Joseph Smith to Oliver Cowdery, and then
            to the Church through Brigham Young and others.” (<em>Joseph the Seer</em>, <em>Ensign</em>, October 2015).
            <br><br>
            This admission marked a complete reversal from previous denials by Church-employed Book of Mormon scholars.
            For instance, Bruce R. McConkie wrote: “David Whitmer maintained the prophet used an oval-shaped,
            chocolate-colored seer stone slightly larger than an egg… Such an explanation is, in our judgement, simply
            fiction created for the purpose of <strong>demeaning</strong> Joseph Smith and to <strong>undermine</strong>
            the validity of the revelations he received after translation the Book of Mormon” (<em>Revelations of the
                Restoration</em>, Deseret Book, 2000: 89-98).
            <br><br>
            Joseph Fielding Smith, one of the most prominent LDS historians (and a prophet of the Church), expressed his
            views on the use of the seer stone in the translation process:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            "While the statement has been made by some writers that the Prophet Joseph Smith used a seer stone part of
            the time in his translating of the record, and information points to the fact that he did have in his
            possession such a stone, yet <strong>there is no authentic statement in the history of the Church which
                states that
                the use of such a stone was made in that translation</strong>. The information is all hearsay, and
            personally, I do
            not believe that this stone was used for this purpose. The reason I give for this conclusion is found in the
            statement of the Lord to the Brother of Jared as recorded in Ether 3:22-24
            <br><br>
            These stones, the Urim and Thummim which were given to the Brother of Jared, were preserved for this very
            purpose of translating the record, both of the Jaredites and the Nephites.<strong>Then again the Prophet was
                impressed by Moroni with the fact that these stones were given for that very purpose. It hardly seems
                reasonable to suppose that the Prophet would substitute something evidently inferior under these
                circumstances</strong>. It may have been so, but it is so easy for a story of this kind to be circulated
            due to the
            fact that the Prophet did possess a seer stone, which he may have used for some other purposes." (Joseph
            Fielding Smith’s, Doctrines of Salvation, 3:225)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            In other words, until the Church was forced to acknowledge the existence of the seer stone—an object it had
            in its possession all along—LDS scholars viewed it as an embarrassment that threatened the legitimacy of
            Joseph Smith's prophetic claims. This is the only plausible reason they kept it under wraps for over a
            century and a half, until they finally had to admit that these so-called "demeaning" lies were, in fact,
            true. Many of us remember a time when rumors of people using stones to receive revelations were condemned as
            the work of the devil—just as Joseph Smith accused Hiram Page of doing when he claimed to receive
            revelations through his seer stone.
            <br><br>
            Apostle Bruce R. McConkie, for example, considered this method of revelation to be a satanic imitation of
            true divine revelation. He wrote, <em>“In imitation of the true order of heaven, whereby seers receive
                revelations from God through a Urim and Thummim, the devil gives his own revelations to some of his
                followers through <strong>peep stones</strong> or crystal balls.”</em> (<em>Mormon Doctrine</em>: 566).

            Joseph found this particular stone while digging a well for Willard Chase. Chase’s niece Sally was also a
            glass-looker who got Joseph interested in the use of rocks for seeing things beneath the ground. When
            Willard heard Joseph’s claims that the rock found on his property had magical powers he tried without
            success to get Joseph to return it. (Willard Chase Affidavit, December 11, 1833).

                Apparently for convenience, Joseph often translated with the single seer stone rather than the two
                stones
                bound together to form the interpreters.
            </span>
            (This is a common apologetic argument, but it just makes no sense. Joseph Smith had the divine instrument
            that God gave him specifically for translation of the plates, but instead he used a stone in a hat, even
            before the angel took the Urim and Thummim from him? We know this because the first-hand eyewitness accounts
            speak only of the rock-and-hat method of translation. It makes you wonder why The Brother of Jared, Ether,
            Moroni, et. al. went to all of the trouble to bring the spectacles across an ocean and preserve them for
            thousands of years if a stone dug out from a neighbor’s yard could accomplish the same goal. Occam's Razor
            would tell us that we must at least consider the possibility that the breastplates and spectacles never
            actually existed, which really would be the most likely explanation for why Joseph always used a stone
            instead. This account also diminishes the gold plates, which were not used in any way to dictate the Book of
            Mormon as we know it. Again, why did God command a man to be murdered to recover plates that were not even
            necessary to translate the Book of Mormon?)

                Latter-day Saints later understood the term

                understood the term more as a descriptive category of instruments for obtaining divine revelations

            The term “Urim and Thummim” was first used by William W. Phelps in 1833, years after the publication of the
            Book of Mormon, and the name was commonly understood to refer to <strong>any</strong> of Joseph Smith’s
            various seer stones.
            Some early saints understood that Joseph actually used a rock in a hat for his visionary and translating
            endeavors. In fact, some members, including David Whitmer, one of the Three Witnesses, <strong>were
                disconcerted
                when Joseph stopped using the 'seer stone' to receive revelation</strong>. It was such an integral part
            of his method
            that when he stopped relying on the seer stone people began to fear that he had become a fallen prophet
            (Whitmer, 1887, An Address to All believers in Christ). The angelic spectacles that we now think of as the
            Urim and Thummim seem to have implanted themselves organically into the story over time and it wasn’t until
            after Joseph’s death that two stones in a silver bow came to be known commonly as the Urim and Thummim, and
            further to be accepted as the device that was used to translate the Book of Mormon. Why did the brown seer
            stone fall out of favor and need to be replaced with something that sounded more divine and directly from
            God? The earliest members of the church were all practitioners and believers of folk magic and treasure
            digging, which they saw as just another component of their religious worldview, but as time passed and folk
            magic came to be viewed with more suspicion, and with increased missionary effort to convert people who did
            not share those views, the church needed to distance itself from glass-looking, dowsing rods, parchments and
            magic daggers, and other practices that were becoming increasingly associated with witchcraft and chicanery.
            <br><br>
            The chocolate-colored stone that Joseph used to produce the Book of Mormon was the exact same stone that he
            used when he and his family were, as Lucy put it “trying to win the faculty of Abrac drawing magic circles
            or sooth saying” in an attempt to find treasure for other people to whom he charged a fee for his
            glass-looking services. Joseph’s primary job in these magical endeavors was to use his seer stone, the same
            one described in this essay as the translation instrument for the Book of Mormon, to “scry,” or magically
            see treasure under the ground. Joseph claimed to have located treasure on a number of occasions, but it was
            always either too deep to excavate or it suddenly moved deeper into the earth at the last moment, dragged
            away from the treasure hunters by its guardian spirit just before they reached it. This seer stone also gave
            Joseph a vision of Captain Kidd sailing on the Susquehanna River and burying treasure there, which Joseph
            later attempted to locate for a fee (Joseph Smith, Captain Kidd Lore, and Treasure-Seeking in New York and
            New England during the Early Republic. Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought, 46(3), 78). Martin Harris, one
            of the Three Witnesses, was also a participant in these midnight treasure ceremonies and he described
            incidents in which the treasure seekers were just on the verge of retrieving the booty when the spirit
            suddenly moved the chest deeper into the earth. Numerous witnesses including Porter Rockwell, (as recounted
            by Brigham Young), Martin Harris, and members of the Josiah Stowell party told tales of Joseph leading them
            to treasure and watching them dig furiously for it, only to have it slip away into the ground just beyond
            their reach. (Journal of Discourses, vol. 19:37), (Tiffany's Monthly, 1859:165) (A New Witness For Christ In
            America, vol. 2:366-67). This concept of slippery treasure was later echoed in the Book of Mormon itself:
            “And behold, the time cometh that he curseth your riches, that they become slippery, that ye cannot hold
            them; and in the days of your poverty ye cannot retain them.(Helaman 13:31)
            <br><br>
            In an 1826 court case recorded as “Same (meaning People) vs Joseph Smith the Glass Looker” Judge Neely Bill
            tried and convicted Joseph Smith for using this same brown stone to defraud people who had paid him to find
            buried treasure. This is the same conviction of which BYU professor and Book of Mormon apologist Hugh Nibley
            was speaking when he said, “...if this court record is authentic it is the most damning evidence against
            Joseph Smith.” (Tinkling Cymbals and Sounding Brass: 276) Nibley believed the court record to be mythical
            but, much to his dismay, it was later produced and proven to be authentic (Joseph Smith and the 1826 Trial:
            New Evidence and New Difficulties, BYU Studies, 12:225.).

                Nevertheless, the scribes and others who observed the translation left numerous
                accounts that give insight into the process. Some accounts indicate that Joseph studied the characters
                on
                the plates. Most of the accounts speak of Joseph’s use of the Urim and Thummim (either the interpreters
                or
                the seer stone), and many accounts refer to his use of a single stone. According to these accounts,

            (It was assumed that English words appeared on the stone, apparently often in Joseph’s own frontier dialect,
            but since Joseph was the only witness of what he saw when his face was in the hat, there is no way to know

                The process as described brings to mind a
                passage from the Book of Mormon that speaks of God preparing “a stone, which shall shine forth in

                unto light.”<a

            (Again, Occam's Razor would tell us that if Joseph Smith was writing the Book of Mormon himself, he would
            absolutely include this in the book to give his story credibility. Joseph Smith also wrote himself into the
            Bible: "And that seer will I bless, and they that seek to destroy him shall be confounded; for this promise
            I give unto you, for I will remember you from generation to generation; and his name shall be called Joseph,
            and it shall be like unto you, for the thing which the Lord shall bring forth by His hand shall bring my

        <p>
            There were numerous eyewitnesses of the translation process and all of them told the same story: Joseph put
            a rock in a hat, sealed his face to the brim and dictated the impressions he received from the rock. He
            <strong>never</strong> looked at the plates, which were either covered with a cloth, locked in a box, or
            even hidden in
            another room or in the woods. Although a number of people described the breastplate and spectacles, no one
            besides Joseph Smith ever claimed to have actually seen them, apart from David Whitmer,<strong>who saw them
                in a
                vision</strong>, sitting on a table in the woods alongside a list of other artifacts including “the
            brass plates, the
            plates of the book of Ether, the plates containing the records of the wickedness and secret combinations of
            the people of the world down to the time of their being engraved, and many other plates” (Journal of
            History, Vol 3:447). He later described this vision as more of an impression than physical sight (Early
            Mormon Documents, 1: 603-05). In fact, the descriptions by others vary dramatically in every detail.
            Joseph’s mother said the breastplate and interpreters were small enough to be completely concealed from her
            vision when wrapped in a handkerchief (Joseph Smith Papers, Lucy Mack Smith, History). Joseph’s brother
            William, however, said the interpreters were designed for men of gigantic stature, and that the spectacles
            were so enormous the Joseph could only look through one lens at a time. (William Smith interview, Early
            Mormon Documents, 1:508). Lucy called the stones “three cornered diamonds set in glass” (History of Joseph
            Smith, Revised and Enhanced: 139), while Martin Harris said in one interview they were opaque white stones
            with gray streaks, but in another that they were clear. Why were the descriptions of the interpreters so
            different? If you saw an artifact that was preserved for thousands of years by the hand of God, would you
            forget the details in such a great magnitude? In fact, Harris said that Joseph was commanded to not let
            anyone see them “lest he should look aught and parish” (Martin Harris Interview, 1859, Early Mormon
            Documents, 2:305). Descriptions of the Gold Plates vary dramatically in the same way, and they also came
            with a penalty of death should anyone look upon them.

                The scribes who assisted with the translation unquestionably believed that Joseph translated by divine
                power. Joseph’s wife Emma explained that she “frequently wrote day after day” at a small table in their
                house in Harmony, Pennsylvania. She described Joseph “sitting with his face buried in his hat, with the
                stone in it, and dictating hour after hour with nothing between us.”<a

            (Again, this shows that Joseph did not need or use the gold plates or the spectacles/breastplate to
            translate, which begs the question as to why so much effort was made to engrave the text on gold sheets and
            preserve them for thousands of years if they were unnecessary to the translation process)

            <span class="essay-text">
                According to Emma, the plates “often lay on the
                table without any attempt at concealment, wrapped in a small linen table cloth.”
            </span>
            (Emma has a very different definition of “without attempt at concealment” than most of us. The plates were
            always covered, even when “hefted” by the eight witnesses because God had threatened to kill Joseph if
            anyone actually saw them with their physical eyes. Joseph said, “I should not show them to any person;
            neither the breastplate with the Urim and Thummim; only to those to whom I should be commanded to show them;
            if I did I should be destroyed” (Joseph Smith - History 1:42) Again, Occam's Razor would telll us that it is
            quite improbable that someone would be given physical evidence and then be commanded, under threat of death,
            not to show that evidence to anyone except under very carefully choreographed circumstances.)

                When asked if Joseph had
                dictated from the Bible or from a manuscript he had prepared earlier, Emma flatly denied those
                possibilities: “He had neither manuscript nor book to read from.” Emma told her son Joseph Smith III,
                “The
                Book of Mormon is of divine authenticity—I have not the slightest doubt of it. I am satisfied that no
                man
                could have dictated the writing of the manuscripts unless he was inspired; for, when acting as his
                scribe,
                your father would dictate to me for hour after hour; and when returning after meals, or after
                interruptions,
                he would at once begin where he had left off, without either seeing the manuscript or having any portion
                of
                it read to him.”<a

            Emma said this in the same interview in which she denied that Joseph ever practiced polygamy, even though
            another LDS Gospel Topics Essay on Nauvoo polygamy (Plural Marriage in Kirtland and Nauvoo, LDS.org) informs
            us that Emma not only knew about Joseph’s polygamy, but even approved of it for a brief time, so this
            interview may not be the most reliable source as clearly Emma is whitewashing history to paint Joseph in the
            best light possible. It also seems disingenuous for the church to use it as an authoritative source here
            when they know it contradicts claims they make elsewhere. The “Last Testimony of Sister Emma” was recorded
            in 1879, at the end of Emma’s life, by her son Joseph III in 1879, 50 years after the events described here.

                penning

            Martin Harris is an interesting character in the Book of Mormon process. He moved around frequently between
            various factions of Mormonism and other religions and witnessed miraculous things in each of them. After
            leaving Mormonism he spent two years in the Shaker church where he was also an eyewitness of that
            denomination’s angel and sacred book. An acquaintance of Martin said, "Harris declared repeatedly that he
            had as much evidence for a Shaker book he had as for the Book of Mormon" (The Braden and Kelly Debate,
            p.173). Harris was also one of the officially documented Three Witnesses of Francis Gladden Bishop, another
            local prophet who claimed to have gold plates, the Urim and Thummim, and other ancient artifacts (Bishop, A
            Proclamation From the Lord to His people, scattered throughout all the Earth, 1851). Harris eventually ended
            up getting heavily involved in spiritualism where he participated in seances and spirit tapping before
            eventually moving to Utah and rejoining the Saints before his death. Martin was infamous for telling stories
            of ghosts and strange things he had seen. At one point he claimed that Jesus appeared to him in the form of
            a deer (Early Mormon Documents, 2: 271).

            The witnesses eventually fell out of Joseph’s favor and in 1838, Joseph said that, "John Whitmer, David
            Whitmer, Oliver Cowdery, and Martin Harris are too mean to mention" (History of the Church, vol. 3, p. 232).
            An official letter from church leaders declared Oliver Cowdery and David Whitmer, “thieves, liars, and
            blacklegs of the deepest dye, to deceive, cheat, and defraud the saints out of their property” (<a

            We are often told that the witnesses never withdrew their testimonies of the Book of Mormon. Perhaps the
            relevant questions are: what exactly did they experience, and how easily were they persuaded? There are
            really only four possible reasons why the Three Witnesses never denied their testimonies of the Book of
            Mormon:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>It all happened exactly as the church manuals say it did.</li>
            <li>Denying their witness would be an admission that they had been deceived.</li>
            <li>One or more of them might have been complicit, and denying the Book of Mormon would have implicated
                themselves.</li>
            <li>The most likely explanation, in my opinion, is that they had no reason to deny an experience that was
                personally significant to them, even if it was a spiritual rather than a literal witness.</li>

                The principal scribe, Oliver Cowdery, testified under oath in 1831 that Joseph Smith “found with the
                plates,
                from which he translated his book, two transparent stones, resembling glass, set in silver bows. That by
                looking through these, he was able to read in English, the reformed Egyptian characters, which were

            that he made this translation attempt not with the Urim and Thummim, but with his dowsing rod. (Oliver
            Cowdery’s Gift, history.lds.org) The original version of D&C 8, which talks about the “Rod of Aaron”
            originally referred to Cowdery’s “Rod of Nature” but was later changed to make it sound more credible. (Book

                resident
                reported that the translation was accomplished by means of “two transparent stones in the form of

            This endnote cites an 1881 Deseret News article about how Martin Harris eventually made his way to Utah. All
            it says about Oliver Cowdery is that “in the company with Joseph Smith, the Prophet, [he] bore the same
            testimony,” and that “those who have honest hearts and obeyed the gospel should receive the Holy Ghost and
            signs would follow them.” <strong> It appears to quote Martin himself as the “village resident”,</strong>
            more that 50 years
            after the supposed statement. Another village resident in this article was said to have spoken in tongues
            which, although we no longer practice this in the church, is cited as further evidence of the truthfulness
            of the LDS church. The article also talks about the time when Harris claimed that a thicket of blackberry
            bushes, animated by the devil, attacked and nearly killed him to prevent him from coming west to Utah.

            Second-hand descriptions of the Urim and Thummim are not proof of their existence anymore than someone
            repeating his uncle’s claim of any other event.There is no question that Joseph claimed at some point to
            have had ancient spectacles with miraculous powers - that is well documented. None of them, according to the
            historic record, actually saw any such device with their physical eyes, despite the fact that we have all
            been led to believe that they did because they gave descriptions of them. A similar problem exists for the
            gold plates themselves. Although some of the eight witnesses were later reported to have restated their
            testimony of the plates, none provided an individual contemporary first-hand account of actually seeing the
            plates with their physical eyes. Many have concluded that they all saw them the same way as Joseph’s brother
            William and others claimed to have “seen” them, always while stored in a box or wrapped in a cloth (Gold
            Plates and Printer’s Ink, Ensign, September, 1976). The only existing source of the testimonies of the Three
            and Eight Witnesses is a document that was not written by them and has all of their names signed in Oliver
            Cowdery’s handwriting (Printer’s Manuscript of the Book of Mormon, circa August 1829–circa January 1830,
            Joseph Smith Papers). One thing that we need to understand about these witnesses is that this was a common
            practice that was in no way unique to the Book of Mormon. Pretty much every book that was being published in
            the region around that time, especially those making remarkable claims of prophecy, visions, angels and
            commandments from God, had a list of witnesses in the preface. The Shaker Book and Roll has over 60
            witnesses of the “Testimonies of eleven mighty Angels, that attended the writing of the Roll,” and other
            miracles of that book’s coming forth. One of Strangite books includes the signatures of seven witnesses who
            describe the metal plates from which the book was produced: “We examined them with our eyes, and handled
            them with our hands. The engravings are beautiful antique workmanship, bearing a striking resemblance to the
            ancient oriental languages.” It was just what people did to give their book a sense of credibility.
            <br><br>
            The last straw for a number of early saints was when Martin Harris declared in a public meeting in Kirtland
            that he “never saw the plates with his natural eyes,” and that “the eight witnesses [also] never saw them &
            hesitated to sign that instrument (testimony) for that reason, but were persuaded to do it.” (Joseph Smith
            Letterbook 2:64, 65). On another occasion Harris said, ”I did not see them as I do that pencil-case, yet I
            saw them with the eye of faith; I saw them just as distinctly as I see any thing around me, though at the
            time they were covered over with a cloth.” (Early Mormon Documents 2:270). Stephen Burnett, a High Priest at
            the time, said that Martin admitted he “had hefted the plates repeatedly in a box with only a tablecloth or
            a handkerchief over them, but he never saw them only as he saw a city throught [sic] a mountain.”(Stephen
            Burnett, April 15, 1838, in Joseph Smith Letter Book, p. 2).
            <br><br>
            David Whitmer revealed that the angel who showed him the plates, "had no appearance or shape." When asked
            how it was that he could claim to have seen and heard an angel, Whitmer replied, "Have you never had
            impressions? Then you had impressions as the Quaker when the spirit moves, or as a good Methodist in giving
            a happy experience, a feeling?" "Just so" (Early Mormon Documents, 1: 603-05). We see a pattern in the way
            artifacts like the gold plates and interpreters were experienced by the early saints, not so much by
            physical sight as by spiritual impression, or what they commonly called “second sight.” Whitmer also said,
            "If you believe my testimony to the Book of Mormon; if you believe that God spake to us three witnesses by
            his own voice, then I tell you that in June, 1838, God spake to me again by his own voice from the heavens,
            and told me to "separate myself from among the Latter Day Saints, for as they sought to do unto me, should
            it be done unto them." If we take Whitmer’s witness of the gold plates at face value then we must also
            accept his declarations that Joseph became a fallen prophet and the church had fallen into apostasy, since
            he credits both revelations to God speaking in “his own voice”(Whitmer, 1887, An Address to All believers in
            Christ).
            <br><br>
            There are quotes where some of the witnesses do profess to have seen the plates with their natural eyes, but
            are also contradicted by quotes from other points of their lives where they refer to only seeing them with
            their spiritual eyes. Again, it begs the question of how such a miraculous event could be remembered
            incorrectly on such a grand scale at various points in time by multiple witnesses - either they were seen in
            a physical form and hefted, or they were seen spiritually - but not both.

                marvelous.

                The truth of the Book of Mormon and its divine source can be known today. God
                invites each of us to read the book, remember the mercies of the Lord and ponder them in our hearts,
                “and
                ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true.” God promises that “if
                ye
                shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of
                it
                unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.”<a

            The common pattern of the Gospel Topic Essays is to present a body of evidence as if they are taking an
            empirical approach to the problem. However, almost as an admission of the weakness of that evidence or for
            members who have researched the many problems with their explanations, they ask you to abruptly stop
            thinking about it and rely instead on emotion-based conclusions.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you take into account the actual method of translation, the accounts regarding the plates and witnesses,
            the time frame, the outside information available to Joseph Smith, and his actual capabilities, it is not
            difficult to imagine a scenario for the creation of the Book of Mormon that is far less miraculous than the
            one we have been taught. Is it really that hard to believe that a man who spent his life selling
            treasure-digging services with a magical worldview could create a book that borrows heavily from the King
            James Bible and other external themes common to his time?
        </p>

        <p>
            After examining these factors, as well as the many archaeological, theological, biological, linguistic,
            genetic, geographic, and textual problems with the Book of Mormon, many have concluded, as did LDS historian
            and General Authority B.H. Roberts, that the Book of Mormon is a 19th-century creation and the product of a
            “young and underdeveloped but piously inclined mind” and “a wonder-tale of an immature mind, unconscious of
            what a test he is laying on human credulity when asking men to accept his narrative as solemn history”
            (Roberts, Studies in the Book of Mormon: 271, 283).
        </p>

        <p>
            Furthermore, this essay sidesteps several difficult issues regarding Joseph Smith's credibility, including:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Why did Joseph Smith use so many verses from the King James Bible, including translation errors? This
                necessitates a 'loose translation' theory, which contradicts the claimed translation method. Either
                Joseph was using outside sources (denied in <em>every</em> account of his translation), or God was
                providing Joseph with errors that were not even written until long after the time of the Book of Mormon.
            </li>

            <li>Why are there verses included from Deutero-Isaiah, written after Lehi's departure, making it impossible
                for them to be present in the plates? Notably, this information was unknown to Joseph Smith at the time
                the Book of Mormon was written.</li>

            <li>Why are there numerous anachronisms from Joseph Smith's time but not the time of the Book of Mormon? Why
                would God reveal things to Joseph Smith that were not present and easily proven false years later?</li>

            <li>Why did Joseph Smith change verses that originally supported a trinitarian view in the Book of Mormon?
                Apologists claim it was for clarification, but this aligns with Joseph's first vision account, where he
                saw only Jesus, as at that time his teachings were very trinitarian. This also contradicts the essay’s
                portrayal of a 'tight translation' because if the original translation was correct, no new words would
                have appeared in Joseph’s hat.</li>

            <li>Why were the 'lost 116 pages' written in such a different style, seemingly avoiding specific details to
                prevent contradictions if the original 116 pages were later found? After the Book of Mormon passes these
                pages, significant changes in detail occur, as if there was no longer fear of exposing contradictions.
            </li>

            <li>Why does the church continue to promote artwork showing Joseph Smith translating the gold plates, when
                they now admit he never used the plates in translation? Why are missionaries still trained to share an
                inaccurate translation story, and how does this align with the honesty principles in the church’s Gospel
                Principles manual?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            None of this necessarily demands the conclusion that there could not have been divine inspiration in the
            creation of the Book of Mormon. It simply suggests that the real story appears to be quite different from
            the history the church has taught for over a century, raising significant questions about the authenticity
            of the Book of Mormon as scripture from God.
        </p>

        <p>
            This essay leads to difficult questions and conclusions, and as a former member of the church, I remain
            angry that the church continues to withhold these truths in missionary and church lessons. Instead, they ask
            members to pray for answers. The reality is that the only way to receive a confirmation that these works are
            from God is to enter prayer already seeking that confirmation. When considered alongside the issues with the
            Book of Abraham and Joseph Smith’s translation of the Bible, the evidence becomes too overwhelming and the
            problems too significant to reasonably conclude that these are the works of God.
        </p>

        <p>
            The church heavily leans on the power of a spiritual witness because it is difficult to challenge.
            Unfortunately, this is a tool used by every church. I refer you to this <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=600&v=UJMSU8Qj6Go&feature=youtu.be">YouTube video</a>, which shows
            how other
            churches, including a polygamous splinter group from the LDS church, use similar spiritual witnesses. It is
            a powerful video demonstrating how spiritual witnesses occur and why the church continues to rely on them in
            the absence of satisfactory answers regarding their history.
        </p>

        <p>
            Thank you for reading this annotated essay to the end. I know it is long, and I understand how difficult it
            can be to confront these things, especially as they were previously unknown to almost all LDS members. I
            hope you will continue to research these issues and be open to exploring both LDS and non-LDS sources to
            gain a full understanding. Beyond the translation issues, there are significant problems within the Book of
            Mormon itself, as noted above. While it can be painful to reach this conclusion, it is better to pursue the
            truth than to ignore it, no matter how difficult it may seem at first.
        </p>

        <p>
            There are many resources available for those experiencing a faith crisis, so please email us if you would
            like help. While the church claims we will be miserable without it ("where will you go?"), the reality is
            that those who learn the truth and move on are often just as, if not more, happy and fulfilled afterward.

                            4:5</a>. Joseph Smith seems to have used the terms “interpreters” and “spectacles”
                        interchangeably during the early years of the Church. Nancy Towle, an itinerant Methodist
                        preacher, recounted Joseph Smith telling her about “a pair of ‘interpreters,’ (as he called
                        them,) that resembled spectacles, by looking into which, he could <em>read</em> a writing
                        engraven upon the plates, though to himself, in a tongue unknown” (Nancy Towle,
                        <cite>Vicissitudes Illustrated in the Experience of Nancy Towle, in Europe and America</cite>
                        [Charleston: James L. Burges, 1832], 138–39). Joseph’s 1832 history referred to “spectacles”
                        (Joseph Smith History, ca. summer 1832, in <cite>Joseph Smith Histories,</cite> 16). In January
                        1833, the Latter-day Saint newspaper <cite>The Evening and the Morning Star,</cite> edited by
                        William W. Phelps, equated “spectacles” and “interpreters” with the term “Urim and Thummim”: the
                        Book of Mormon “was translated by the gift and power of God, by an unlearned man, through the
                        aid of a pair of Interpreters, or spectacles— (known, perhaps, in ancient days as Teraphim, or
                        Urim and Thummim)” (“The Book of Mormon,” <cite>The Evening and the Morning Star,</cite> January
                        1833, [2]). By 1835 Joseph Smith most often used the term “Urim and Thummim” when speaking of
                        translation and rarely, if ever, used the terms “interpreters” or “spectacles” (Joseph Smith,
                        Journal, Nov. 9–11, 1835, in <cite>Journals: Volume 1: 1832–1839,</cite> 89; Joseph Smith,

                    <p>Joseph Smith probably possessed more than one seer stone; he
                        appears to have found one of the stones while digging for a well around 1822. (Richard L.
                        Bushman, <cite>Joseph Smith and the Beginnings of Mormonism</cite> [Urbana: University of

                        According to Martin Harris, an angel commanded Joseph Smith
                        to stop these activities, which he did by 1826. (See Bushman, <cite>Joseph Smith and the
                            Beginnings of Mormonism,</cite> 64–76; and Richard Lloyd Anderson, “The Mature Joseph Smith
                        and Treasure Searching,” <cite>BYU Studies</cite> 24, no. 4 [Fall 1984]: 489–560.) Joseph did
                        not hide his well-known early involvement in treasure seeking. In 1838, he published responses
                        to questions frequently asked of him. “Was not Jo Smith a money digger,” one question read.
                        “Yes,” Joseph answered, “but it was never a very profitable job to him, as he only got fourteen
                        dollars a month for it.” (Selections from <cite>Elders’ Journal,</cite> July 1838, 43, available

                            translation in August 1829: Jonathan Hadley, a Palmyra printer who may have spoken with
                            Joseph
                            Smith about translation, claimed that the plates were found with a “huge pair of
                            Spectacles,”
                            and that “by placing the Spectacles in a hat, and looking into it, Smith could (he said so,
                            at
                            least,) interpret these characters.” (“Golden Bible,” <cite>Palmyra Freeman,</cite> Aug. 11,
                            1829, [2].) In the winter of 1831, a Shaker in Union Village, Ohio, spoke of “two
