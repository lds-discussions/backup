        <p>Prophet Ezra Taft Benson famously said that “... the Book of Mormon is the keystone of our religion. This was
            the Prophet Joseph Smith’s statement. He testified that ‘the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book
            on earth, and the keystone of our religion’ (Introduction to the Book of Mormon). A keystone is the central
            stone in an arch. It holds all the other stones in place, and if removed, the arch crumbles.”(<a
                href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1986/10/the-book-of-mormon-keystone-of-our-religion?lang=eng">October
                1986 General Conference</a>)
        </p>

        <p>
            This statement is absolutely true. If the Book of Mormon is a true historical record, then it is not only
            the keystone of Mormonism, but the more important book to ever be written. On the other hand, if the Book of
            Mormon is not a true, historical record as it proclaims to be, then the entire church falls along with the
            credibility of the founding prophet of the church, Joseph Smith.

        <p>
            We are going to focus on a series of overviews about the Book of Mormon, but it is crucial to start at the
            beginning to understand the full context of how the Book of Mormon plates came to be, how the plates were
            translated, and what the Book of Mormon itself tells us about its claim as a literal, historical record.
        </p>

        <p>In this first overview we are going to outline Joseph Smith’s time as a money digger/treasure seeker. This is
            incredibly important to understanding the Book of Mormon, and it begins with Joseph Smith’s time as a
            ‘treasure or money digger’ in the years leading up to the recovery of the gold plates and translation of the
            Book of Mormon.</p>

        <h3>Joseph Smith and the Magical World View</h3>

        <p>Joseph Smith lived in a time where some people believed and participated in what is sometimes called a
            magical worldview or 'folk magic.' Visions were common, revivals were sweeping the area in the mid 1820s,
            and some people even believed they could see buried treasure by divine means. This was especially common in
            the New England area, where Joseph Smith and the foundational families of Mormonism lived.</p>

        <p>As Eric A. Eliason explains:</p>

        <blockquote>
            “In frontier America, seer stones or “peep stones” were commonly used by lost object finders, people engaged
            in the widespread practice of lost treasure digging, and sometimes by people seeking to uncover the kind of
            truths we might call a private or police detective for today. It is unclear how much of this kind of
            activity Joseph Smith was involved in, except for water divining and treasure digging, which are widely
            attested.” (BYU Studies Quarterly, Vol.55, No.1, 2016)
        </blockquote>

        <p>Treasure seekers would claim to see lost objects or buried treasure by using various means, including putting
            a ‘peep stone’ in a hat, blocking out all light around their faces, and using magic rituals to keep the
            treasure from ‘slipping’ deeper into the earth. Other treasure seekers, such as Joseph Smith’s key scribe in
            the Book of Mormon translation Oliver Cowdery, used objects such as “divining rods” to locate objects below
            the ground such as water, buried metals, or gems in what was sometimes described as “water witching” or
            “dowsing.”</p>

        <p>
            These kinds of magical objects and ideas are embedded in literature whether it's the magic mirror in Snow
            White or the palantír in the Lord of the Rings . In fact, this description of the palantír is pretty
            striking to what we will see with Joseph Smith and his worldview: "A major theme of palantír usage is that
            while the stones show real objects or events, those using the stones had to "possess great strength of will
            and of mind" to direct the stone's gaze to its full capability." (Tolkien, J.R.R., The Silmarillion, p. 302)
        </p>

        <p>Ronald W. Walker, the Director of Center for Western Studies at BYU and president of the Mormon History
            Association, explains treasure digging in more detail:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “From Colonial times to at least the age of Jackson [1776-1837] Americans dug for magical treasure. There
            were hundreds and probably thousands of these money-diggers all seeking troves of fabled coins, mines,
            jewels and other valued prizes... The money-diggers placed faith in conjuring elemental spirits, thrice
            spoken dreams, seeric gifts, and enchanted treasure.

            “A second treasure-finding device used by adepts was the “peep” or “seer” stone, whose acclaimed gifts
            excelled even those of the divining rod. Such stones seemed to be everywhere and were of every possible
            description. Such stones seemed to be everywhere and were of every possible description. A Rochester, New
            York practitioner found his stone lying in a road. The "dazzling splendor" of this three or four inch piece
            of quartz caused him to fall down insensible. Joseph Smith’s various stones reportedly included a smooth
            grey egg-shaped rock found in a neighbor’s well, a second which he reportedly dug up near Lake Erie after
            espying it in his neighbor’s stone and still others collected from the Mississippi River sands near Nauvoo,
            Illinois.”

            “While finding the right moment to dig was important, the need to circumvent the treasure’s guardian was
            crucial. Like its Old World antecedents, the American treasure keeper might be demonic or divine. Or it
            could be a cat, dog, snake or some other protecting animal. But generally, the American treasure guardian
            was a murdered youth or man whose body had been left with the buried valuables to ensure their protection.
            Guardian Indians were a frequent motif while a murdered pirate protected Captain Kidd’s troves.” (
            <a href="https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2288&context=byusq">Ronald W.
                Walker – The Persisting Idea of American Treasure Hunting</a>)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            What is important to note here is that treasure diggers would sell their service to others, and would be paid to dig into large hills to find the treasure that the “seer” could watch from his peep/seer stone in a hat. We’re not talking about small holes in a hill here, but caves that are carved out on the sides of hills. Here are photos from the hole in Miner’s Hill that was dug during one of Joseph Smith’s treasure digs:
        </p>

        <p>
            Furthermore, and this is really important, treasure diggers never actually found the treasure they claimed to see. If they could find treasure, they would not need to find someone else to pay them to dig – they would just dig it out themselves. This is like a psychic on television telling you they can predict the winner of a football game or the best stocks to pick – if they could actually do any of it, they’d just become rich on their own, but throughout history people have found ways to defraud others of their money using claims of divine abilities.
