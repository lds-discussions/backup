        <h1>About That Gold Plates Video (June 18, 2020)​</h1>

        <p>
            On April 13, 2020, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints released another video in their "Now You
            Know" series, this time focusing on the 'gold plates' containing the Book of Mormon <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EUGSlra2Cg">(What Are the Book of Mormon Gold Plates? | Now You
                Know)</a>. We have covered some of
            the other recent "Now You Know" videos including the Word of Wisdom, Masonry and the Temple, Seer Stones,
            and Joseph Smith.
            <br><br>
            It's a short video and we're not going to spend a ton of time here rehashing it, but just as we did with the
            other videos, I want to point out some of the ways that it feels like the church is still dodging and
            skirting difficult issues while inoculating members about topics that don't add up.
            <br><br>
            Just like the Saints book, the church continues to use fluffy language and very misleading imagery to avoid
            giving any real details of why the story of the gold plates simply does not add up historically. In
            addition, this video continues a pattern of using Book of Mormon reformed Egyptian "caractors" that are 100%
            made up, which is because the real "caractors" document that has actual Book of Mormon characters is simply
            modified English letters and numbers. We will cover that below, but it is a really obvious area they do not
            want members to look to closely at.
            <br><br>
            Below is the text of the video with some comments about why the church is still being misleading about the
            gold plates even in 2019 when the information is so readily available. We have not previously written about
            the gold plates in a separate piece, it is a big part of our annotated essay on the Book of Mormon
            translation, which I highly recommend for so much more detail on the translation process. From the video:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            "You may have heard members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints talk about the gold plates.
            So what are the gold plates? What were they like, and why do we still talk about them?
            <br><br>
            In 1820 a young boy named Joseph Smith prayed to know which church he should join. In response, Joseph was
            visited by God and Jesus Christ. God later called Joseph Smith to be his prophet on the Earth. A few years
            after God and Jesus Christ visited Joseph Smith, an angel named Moroni also appeared to him. Moroni told
            Joseph about an ancient record buried in a hill near Joseph's house. The record, written on gold plates,
            contained the writings of prophets who lived in the Americas centuries earlier. The plates were similar to
            other ancient metal records that have been discovered by archaeologists in recent years."
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            The video starts off with Joseph Smith's First Vision, which we document extensively in our First Vision
            Overview. Historically speaking, Joseph Smith's First Vision could not have happened in 1820, but in 1824.
            <br><br>
            And you can see here why that is such a problem. If the First Vision happened in 1824 as Joseph Smith's
            details would indicate, than Joseph claiming to be visited by Moroni in 1823 is a problem. We see a lot of
            these kinds of chronological issues that get backdated and retrofitted in church history:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                The church needs to date the revelation on polygamy back to 1831 because Joseph Smith had a sexual
                relationship with Fanny Alger in the mid 1830s, but the only revelation in 1831 is for the early church
                leaders to take on Native American wives to make their children "white and delightsome." To put it
                another way, even if we claim the 1831 is real (it has a source in both a faithful member and a critic
                who left the church), it would not help to rationalize the Fanny Alger affair.
            </li>
            <li>
                The church needs the Melchizedek priesthood restoration to have been in 1829, but you can see through
                historical documentation that it wasn't developed until 1831. That means that Joseph Smith's claimed
                vision of Peter, James, and John (which was added to the original revelation years later in 1835) could
                not have happened since the idea of a higher priesthood wasn't even developed yet.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Put another way, this video starts off with a historical problem that will only get compounded as we go
            through church history. And the timeline does not even get into the bigger problem of this video: Joseph
            Smith's original account of his First Vision is clear that he only sees one personage - not two. Again we
            detail all of this in the First Vision Overview, but the problem with trying to make such a cute, simple
            video for church history - it becomes really easy to show how they are being misleading and why they are
            being misleading.
            <br><br>
            One last point on this first part - the church very quickly drops this line in before transitioning away:
            "The plates were similar to other ancient metal records that have been discovered by archaeologists in
            recent years."
            <br><br>
            This is something apologists like to cite in order to give the Book of Mormon credibility, but there is no
            finding that bolsters the Book of Mormon's case in any reasonable way.
            <br><br>
            The ancient metal "records" are typically one sheet of metal and will have just a few sentences worth of
            material on them. Any idea that there are long form records on ancient metal plates is simply non-existent,
            and the church knows this or you would see this proof in every Ensign. I don't know how else to say it - the
            church is being intentionally dishonest here by dropping this line to add credibility when they know full
            well that this is simply not an accurate statement.
        </p>

        <figcaption>The Pyrgi Tablets, sheets of gold with a bilingual treatise in Etruscan and Phoenician</figcaption>
        <br>

        <p>
            A very common example of ancient writing on metal plates is the Pyrgi Tablets. Take a look at how little
            text is on those three plates. If anything, the Pyrgi Tablets show
            how implausible the Book of Mormon is when you take a step back and think of the implications. And not only
            that, but these plates have been seen by people who are not close to Joseph Smith and in a language that has
            a historical basis.
            <br><br>
            In other words, the apologetics to show that there was ancient writing on metal opens up more problems for
            the plausibility of the Book of Mormon, which is why the church wants to just casually drop that line and
            run before you actually take a look at their claims.
        </p>

        <img src="images/gold-plates-video-1.webp" alt="screenshot" class="image-style-medium">

        <p>
            Back to the video:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            "Four years after Moroni first told Joseph about the plates, Joseph retrieved them from the hill and
            translated them by the gift and power of God. It was the Book of Mormon, another testament of Jesus Christ.
            Several people, including members of Joseph Smith's family as well as his friends, handled the gold plates.
            They describe what they saw and felt. The plates measured eight inches in length and about six or seven
            inches wide. All together, the plates were around 4 to 6 inches thick. And they were pretty heavy. According
            to people who held the plates, they likely weighed somewhere between 40 and 60 lbs. The plates were bound
            together with three large D shaped rings. The individual plates were as thin as parchment paper, and they
            were slightly flexible. A part of the plates was sealed together so Joseph couldn't translate that part."
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            There are a few details being left out here. First, Joseph Smith attempted to get the plates four times -
            each time on the Autumnal equinox, which is a very important date for folk magic. This is because Joseph
            Smith's family was into folk magic, and Joseph Smith himself was a treasure digger. He used to charge people
            to look for hidden objects using a stone in a hat.
            <br><br>
            We cover this in our annotated Book of Mormon translation essay, but this is very important because Joseph
            Smith will use the same stone in a hat to translate the Book of Mormon that he used to (unsuccessfully) look
            for buried treasure. The gold plates were not used in the translation process, which was a shock for me
            since the missionaries testified of Joseph Smith translating the plates and I in turn received a
            confirmation that this is how the Book of Mormon came to be.
            <br><br>
            In fact, Joseph Smith used this same stone in a hat to claim to locate the gold plates in the Hill Cumorah,
            which is again problematic because he never once found treasure using this method. This is also why other
            treasure diggers believed Joseph Smith when he claimed to find the plates, even going to the Hill Cumorah to
            try and steal them before Joseph Smith could fully dig them out. We will get to that a bit more in a few
            paragraphs.
            <br><br>
            Another problem here is that the church mentions that those gold plates would weigh up to 60 lbs. This is a
            problem because Joseph Smith tells the story of running from the other treasure diggers who want a piece of
            Joseph's claimed treasure. From the 2001 Ensign:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            "As he was jumping over a log, a man sprang up from behind and gave him a heavy blow with a gun. Joseph
            turned around and knocked him to the ground, and then ran at the top of his speed. About half a mile
            further, he was attacked again in precisely the same way. He soon brought this one down also and ran on
            again, but before he got home, he was accosted the third time with a severe stroke with a gun." Joseph
            struck this third and final attacker with such force that he dislocated his own thumb. He continued running,
            "being closely pursued until he came near his father's house," at which time his assailants, "for fear of
            being detected," broke off the chase. Reaching a fence corner, he "threw himself down … to recover his
            breath," then rose and continued running until he reached the house." <a

                Heed Continually”:
                Protecting the Gold Plates)</a>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Now just think about this story combined with the idea that Joseph Smith was carrying a SIXTY pound book
            while doing this. It defies all logic, reason, and physics to think that Joseph Smith could run at "top
            speed" with a 60 pound book while fighting off attackers.
            <br><br>
            While this story certainly adds to the legend of the Book of Mormon's creation, it also creates a lot of
            other problems. For example, Joseph Smith told others that they could not look at the plates and live. If
            that was truly the case, why not let the attackers look at them? They would die and Joseph could continue
            on. This story is full of holes once you look at the bigger picture against the accounts and evidence we
            have.
            <br><br>
            One theory that historian Dan Vogel has stated is that Joseph Smith was creating a "prop" set of plates so
            that he could cover them and witnesses could hear the plates rustling, and that he dislocated his thumb when
            he was finishing the "D rings" on the book as they would need a lot of force from that part of the hand to
            finish them into the correct shape.
            <br><br>
            The Book of Mormon does have the statement of the witnesses to build testimony for its authenticity, but
            again the witness statements become problematic when you take a deep dive into them. I would refer you to
            Dan Vogel's YouTube video series on the witnesses as he covers in great detail (and with careful sourcing)
            the problems regarding the reliability with the witness statements.

            From the video:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            "Ancient prophets etched their records on similar plates and a language they call "reformed Egyptian." They
            recorded the history of their people and the teachings they received from God. The greatest event recorded
            in the Book of Mormon is the personal visit of the Lord Jesus Christ, after his resurrection to the ancient
            people of the Americas. He established his church, healed the sick, and taught people his gospel. About 300
            years after the visit of Jesus Christ to the Americas, a prophet named Mormon made the gold plates and
            condensed hundreds of years of prophets' writings onto his pages. That's why it's called the Book of Mormon
            - after the name of the prophet editor."
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This is the part I mentioned at the beginning, where the church shows a cartoon of an ancient prophet
            writing in reformed Egyptian. If you look at the video, you'll see characters that look like an ancient
            language. But take a look at the Book of Mormon symbols from the "caractors" document above - they do not
            match what the video uses.
            <br><br>
            You'll notice that while the video shows what appears to be an ancient record, the actual symbols that we do
            have look like crudely modified English letters and numbers. Why would the church make up symbols for the
            video when they have their own document showing what the characters would have actually looked like? In
            other words, why make up material in order to avoid using the actual historical document? They include these
            same made-up symbols on their Now You Know video for the Seer Stone, and it is very sad that they are so
            embarrassed by their actual historical documents that they will literally make up new characters to avoid
            showing them.
            <br><br>
            As was illustrated by Sandra and Jerald Tanner, the "caractors" from the Book of Mormon are not reformed
            Egyptian, but deformed English:

        <p>Back to the video:​</p>

        <blockquote>
            "He gave the gold place to his son, Moroni. Yes, that Moroni, who buried them in a hill to protect and
            preserve them. The plates lay hidden underground for over 1,000 years until Moroni appeared to Joseph Smith
            and told him to retrieve them. On the title page of the Book of Mormon, the prophet Mormon wrote that the
            Book of Mormon was written to show the entire world that Jesus is the Christ, the eternal God, manifesting
            himself unto all nations. And after translating the Book of Mormon, Joseph Smith testified that the Book of
            Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get
            nearer to God by abiding by its precepts than by any other book."
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            I don't have much to add to this, but I would just note that when you look at all of work that was supposed
            to have happened to preserve the plates, doesn't it seem a bit odd that Joseph Smith never even looked at
            them to translate the book?
            <br><br>
            The idea that Joseph Smith used a "prop" set of plates was laughed off by apologists for years, but now that
            even the church admits that Joseph Smith translated the book with a stone in a hat, it seems more than
            likely that the plates were not ancient since they usually not even in the same room as Joseph Smith.
            <br><br>
            In other words, we are to believe that all of the Book of Mormon prophets wrote down their history in an
            unknown language, preserved these plates with their lives, had those records abridged into another set of
            plates in an unknown language, carried them all the way to the Hill Cumorah, and then buried them at the
            Hill Cumorah (which was believed to be the Book of Mormon Hill Cumorah until science and archaeology proved
            that impossible) all so Joseph Smith could use a rock in a hat to translate the book?
            <br><br>
            A last note on this section is the idea that the Book of Mormon is the most correct book on Earth. We can
            show where Joseph Smith borrowed parts of Isaiah that were written after Lehi left for America
            (Deuetero-Isaiah), we show where Joseph Smith changed the Book of Mormon to match his idea of the godhead,
            and the Book of Mormon is full of anachronisms both of items (horses, steel, silk, elephants, etc) and
            concepts (knowing of Jesus Christ before even the Israelites did, a literal global flood, a literal Tower of
            Babel, etc). There is absolutely no way that the Book of Mormon is historical when it couldn't even identify
            the Lamanites which Joseph Smith claimed through revelation were the Native Americans, which makes this
            claim of being the most correct book simply false.
            <br><br>
            And now the last section of the video:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            "Once the work of translation was finished, Moroni again appeared to Joseph and took back the gold plates.
            So why do we talk so much about the gold plates? The gold plates came to us by the power of God. Written on
            the plates was the Book of Mormon, another testament of Jesus Christ. Multiple witnesses saw and handled the
            gold plates. For the rest of their lives, they testified that the plates were real. The plates are tangible
            evidence linking the translated Book of Mormon to the ancient prophets who wrote it. And by reading the Book
            of Mormon, we can draw closer to Jesus Christ and learn more about his gospel. We talk about the gold plates
            because their story shows us how much God loves us and how he wants us to know his truth.
            <br><br>
            Now you know."
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            There's not much to say here that was not already covered above. We are told Joseph Smith gave the plates
            back after the witnesses saw them, but again the witness statements have huge problems as does the idea that
            the plates were taken back since the Hill Cumorah has been scanned and there's nothing inside.
            <br><br>
            The video ends by saying the plates are "tangible evidence," yet even the few people who claimed to see them
            had massive contradictions in their recollections after signing the witness statement. As I mentioned above,
            please give the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-jNV6jN-VQ">Dan Vogel YouTube series</a> on the
            witnesses a watch if you want a detailed history of the
            witness accounts along with incredibly detailed sourcing.
            <br><br>
            These "Now You Know" videos all follow the same pattern that began with Saints. That is to address a problem
            without actually saying what the evidence is behind the problem, cover it with fluffy language, and then
            tell members that everything is OK.
            <br><br>
            But even in this 4 minute video, you can see the problems it opens up with the First Vision, the idea of
            gold plates, the problem with the translation of the Book of Mormon, and even the witnesses.
            <br><br>
            And every time you research one of these problems, you can see the patterns that tie them together. As we
            mentioned above, the timeline of the First Vision is a deeply problematic one, because if it happened in
            1824 as the history would suggest, then Joseph Smith's claimed vision from Moroni could not have happened.
            It's the same issue with the polygamy revelation and the priesthood restoration - so much of the church's
            history was retrofitted as the ideas evolved, and once you start to see the pattern, the unmistakable
            conclusion becomes clear.
            <br><br>
            Put another way: Why would the gold plates be so sacred that no one else could even see them that was not
            close to Joseph Smith? We could all see the Book of Abraham papyri, we can all see ancient scrolls for books
            of the Bible, but we can't see the evidence of an ancient civilization that wrote in a language never known?
            It just doesn't pass the smell test, and when you look at the evidence, it becomes simply impossible. We can
            see that by looking at the timeline of events, the history of the Americas, migration patterns, DNA studies,
            and a textual analysis of the Book of Mormon itself.
            <br><br>
            One of the patterns I have encountered since researching church history is that every time an apologists
            explains away a problem, their reasoning opens up ten more issues. In this case, there is no common sense
            reason that Joseph Smith would use a rock in a hat to translate the Book of Mormon with the same method he
            used to never find anything while a treasure digger. It's not as if he had a track record of success and
            realized it would be easier - the idea that this was out of "convenience" papers right over all of the
            effort, lives lost, and importance of the actual gold plates.
        </p>

        <img src="images/gold-plates-video-2.webp" alt="screenshot" class="image-style-medium">

        <p>
            think this image from the Now You Know video sums up exactly what I'm getting at. They show Joseph Smith
            sitting at a table with the gold plates just as the church's history has done in order to continue the idea
            that Joseph Smith actually used the plates in translation. Yet in the seer stone video that was released
            last June they admit that Joseph Smith used a rock in a hat to translate it, as you can see below.
        </p>

        <img src="images/seer-stone-video-1.webp" alt="screenshot" class="image-style-medium">

        <p>
            Why in the world would the church release a video in June 2019 that clarifies that Joseph Smith actually
            used a rock in a hat to translate the Book of Mormon just to contradict it 10 months later? The reason is
            actually quite simple: The gold plates simply do not make sense if Joseph Smith never actually used them.
            Put aside for a second all of the manuals, missionary discussions, and artwork depicting Joseph Smith using
            the gold plates for a second and just think about what purpose the gold plates have if Joseph Smith could
            just do it with a rock in a hat?
            <br><br>
            Of course the apologetic argument is that the gold plates served as a witness of the authenticity of the
            Book of Mormon. But if that is the case, why would only a few close friends and family members of Joseph
            Smith be allowed to see them? Why not a few skeptical people in the town? A local newspaper? The reason is
            quite obvious when you look at all of the evidence, and the reason that the church still works so hard to
            make the gold plates relevant, even if it contradicts a video that just released ten months ago.
            <br><br>
            If you've read this far, I hope you will take some time to read a few more resources that relate to this
            issue. They are not fun to read as a believing member, but no matter how much we want something to be true,
            if it can not stand up to scrutiny it is not worth our time, identity, and obedience.
