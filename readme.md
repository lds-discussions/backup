## LDS Discussions Backup Site
This repository is a clone of the original LDS Discussions website. The purpose of 
this project is to preserve the material created by the original authors in case the 
site is ever taken down or seized. By keeping a backup, we aim to ensure that the valuable 
historical insights and perspectives on Mormonism remain accessible.

## About the Content
The original site, LDS Discussions, explores various topics of Mormonism from a historical
 perspective, using mostly LDS sources. The content was created by former members of the LDS 
Church and incorporates both critical and apologetic viewpoints. The goal is to provide a 
comprehensive view of controversial topics using sourced references, making it clear that 
this is not "anti-Mormon" content, but rather a documentation of history as understood by 
the authors. Additionally, the site includes annotated versions of the official LDS Church 
essays on controversial issues, highlighting areas where the authors believe the Church's 
statements are misleading or incomplete.

## Why This Project is Important
The authors of the original site have put a tremendous amount of effort into researching 
and presenting this material. By replicating the site in this repository, we aim to preserve 
their work and ensure it remains available even if the original site becomes inaccessible. 
This project serves as a backup and a potential way to re-upload the content 
to the internet if necessary.

## How to Contribute

to suggest changes or enhancements to the project. Your support can help maintain
