        <h1>Overview of Polygamy, Part 1: Timeline and Introduction</h1>

        <p>
            In my previous overviews, I primarily focused on scriptural discussions with a few insights into the
            church’s foundational events. So far, I've written sixteen overviews on the Book of Mormon and biblical
            scholarship, two sections on the Book of Abraham, and two covering historical issues on the First Vision and
            the restoration of the priesthood.
            <br><br>
            Now, it’s time to address polygamy—a distinct and complex topic compared to the others. I want to highlight
            the historical issues surrounding it and share that, personally, this was the first issue in church history
            that deeply troubled me as both a convert and a believing member. While I remain a member of record, my
            concerns with polygamy contributed significantly to my current inactivity; it has always felt unresolved and
            problematic.
            <br><br>
            This issue unsettles me on an emotional level, beyond the historical problems of previous overviews. I share
            this upfront because it's uncomfortable, and reading about how Joseph Smith practiced polygamy brings up
            feelings of anger, disgust, and embarrassment.
            <br><br>
            As a convert, I was never informed that Joseph Smith himself practiced polygamy. While I was aware polygamy
            was part of church history and doctrine, I didn’t know the specifics of its implementation. Given the weight
            of this topic in understanding church history, I've divided the material into three parts to keep it
            manageable. Hopefully, this structure will make it more accessible for anyone working through the details.
            <br><br>
            If you're unfamiliar with the church's history of polygamy, I want to prepare you: these overviews might be
            uncomfortable. I recently came across a tweet that aptly captured this sentiment:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “Studying history will sometimes disturb you. <br>
            Studying history will sometimes upset you. <br>
            Studying history will sometimes make you furious. <br>
            If studying history always makes you feel proud and happy, you probably aren’t studying history.”
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            I'm making this clear because these sections are markedly different from prior overviews. The topic of
            polygamy brings up a lot of difficult material, including accounts of Joseph Smith's relationships with
            younger women, his use of authority to persuade them, and the secrecy involved, often without his first wife
            Emma’s knowledge.
            <br><br>
            What I've observed about polygamy is that many members find ways to rationalize it, often by not
            scrutinizing how it actually happened. It's one of those areas where the church tends to say, "It’ll all
            work out" or "We just don’t know." Yet, this is still a doctrine of the church. I believe every member
            should understand how Joseph Smith practiced and introduced polygamy, as it remains church doctrine.
            <br><br>
            For women in the church, this doctrine has significant implications for the future. While many say "we
            always have a choice," in polygamy, that choice is often framed as either acceptance or "destruction." This
            is not an exaggeration, as I’ll explain in detail. Although the church may not discuss it openly, this
            doctrine remains foundational in the concept of eternal life for every woman.
            <br><br>
            While my previous twenty-two overviews have shown that the church may not align with its truth claims, this
            series will illustrate that some of Joseph Smith’s and the church’s unique doctrines may not align with
            concepts of goodness either. I mention this upfront because, for a believing member, these sections may be
            challenging—but they are necessary for a complete understanding of church history and the evidence against
            its truth claims.
            <br><br>
            From the church’s most recent handbook changes:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            In today’s world, information is easy to access and share. This can be a great blessing for those seeking to
            be educated and informed. However, many sources of information are unreliable and do not edify. Some sources
            seek to promote anger, contention, fear, or baseless conspiracy theories (see 3 Nephi 11:30; Mosiah 2:32).
            Therefore, it is important that Church members be wise as they seek truth.” (Official Church Handbook)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            To be clear: The true history of polygamy is in no way edifying. The church advises against sources that
            don't edify, but these topics, like the others, are based on documented, evidence-based history. If they
            don't uplift, it isn’t due to the influence of Satan or the ‘adversary’; it's because polygamy's history is
            far more troubling than what members are typically taught.
            <br><br>
            Before diving into Joseph Smith’s polygamy and its place in the church, I’d like to provide context by
            examining how other self-proclaimed prophets initiated polygamous or sexual relationships with their
            followers. As Jonathan Streeter highlighted in his presentation at Sunstone regarding Joseph Smith and the
            Happiness Letter to Nancy Rigdon:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            "Keep in mind that special divine permission is nothing new... Self proclaimed prophet David Koresh and the
            Branch Davidians claimed special divine permission to take child brides for the purpose of producing the 24
            elders foretold in the Book of Revelations. Self proclaimed prophet Wayne Bent of the Lord Our Righteousness
            Church claimed special divine permission for having sexual relations with children, even his own daughter in
            law in order to avoid God's punishment. Self proclaimed prophet Julius Shacknow of the sect known as The
            Work, claimed special privilege to promise salvation in exchange for sexual intercourse with women and
            children, including his own stepdaughter. Self proclaimed prophet Tony Alamo of Alamo Christian Ministries
            claimed special biblical permission to illegally marry multiple women and children. Self proclaimed prophet
            David Berg of the Children of God claimed special divine permission to normalize sexual relation with
            children. Prophets, justifying their own predations as special, divine permission through the use of pious
            language and religious sentiment, is nothing new." (<a

        <p>
            In this first overview, I'll present a timeline and background of polygamy and the creation of Doctrine &
            Covenants 132. In part two, I’ll explore how Joseph Smith practiced polygamy and polyandry, including
            examples of those who accepted and those who rejected his advances. Finally, in part three, we’ll examine
            the apologetic responses to polygamy.
        </p>

        <h2>An Overview of the Polygamy Timeline</h2>

        <p>
            In our annotated essay on polygamy, we explain why the church’s claim that the revelation was given to
            Joseph Smith in 1831 is <strong>not supported</strong> by evidence. Therefore, it’s essential to establish a
            concise timeline
            of key events leading up to the creation of Doctrine & Covenants 132:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>1833:</strong> Joseph Smith begins a polygamous/extramarital relationship with Fanny Alger. The
                church later describes this as a marriage, but no records from the time exist, and the first mention of
                marriage appears over 60 years after the event.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>1835:</strong> The church, under Joseph Smith's leadership, adds a section to the Doctrine and
                Covenants condemning polygamy.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>1836:</strong> Joseph Smith reports a vision of Elijah and Elias to restore priesthood keys,
                later interpreted to include the authority for sealing marriages.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>1841:</strong> Joseph’s polygamous marriages in Nauvoo begin with Louisa Beaman.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>1842:</strong> Joseph temporarily suspends polygamous marriages after John Bennett's “spiritual
                wifery” scandal is exposed.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>1843:</strong> Joseph resumes polygamy, marrying more than a dozen women, bringing the total to
                over 30.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>July 12, 1843:</strong> Joseph Smith dictates a revelation on polygamy to William Clayton, which
                later becomes Doctrine & Covenants 132.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Book of Mormon and Polygamy</h2>

        <p>
            In previous discussions, I’ve presented reasons for viewing Joseph Smith as the author of the Book of
            Mormon. In those analyses, I highlighted instances where Smith integrates his own experiences and the
            surrounding ideas of his time. This context makes the Book of Mormon’s section on polygamy, found in Jacob
            2, particularly noteworthy.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            24 Behold, David and Solomon truly had many wives and concubines, which thing was abominable before me,
            saith the Lord.
            <br><br>
            25 Wherefore, thus saith the Lord, I have led this people forth out of the land of Jerusalem, by the power
            of mine arm, that I might raise up unto me a righteous branch from the fruit of the loins of Joseph.
            <br><br>
            26 Wherefore, I the Lord God will not suffer that this people shall do like unto them of old.
            <br><br>
            27 Wherefore, my brethren, hear me, and hearken to the word of the Lord: For there shall not any man among
            you have save it be one wife; and concubines he shall have none;
            <br><br>
            28 For I, the Lord God, delight in the chastity of women. And whoredoms are an abomination before me; thus
            saith the Lord of Hosts.
            <br><br>
            29 Wherefore, this people shall keep my commandments, saith the Lord of Hosts, or cursed be the land for
            their sakes.
            <br><br>
            30 For if I will, saith the Lord of Hosts, raise up seed unto me, I will command my people; otherwise they
            shall hearken unto these things. <br>
            (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/2?lang=eng" target="_blank">Book
                of Mormon. <em>Jacob 2: 24-30</em></a>)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            In the Book of Mormon, God tells the people, “to excuse themselves in committing whoredoms, because of the
            things which were written concerning David, and Solomon his son” (Jacob 2:23).
            <br><br>
            Here, the author of the Book of Mormon appears to reference David and Solomon to clarify a moral point for
            the reader. This text could be interpreted as providing a potential loophole for polygamy, although it's
            unclear if this was the author's intention.
            <br><br>
            This passage is especially significant because, as we will see when we examine Doctrine and Covenants 132,
            Joseph Smith does more than just contradict the Book of Mormon’s stance on polygamy—he reframes how God
            views David and Solomon’s many wives and concubines.
        </p>

        <h2>The 1831 Revelation on Polygamy</h2>

        <p>
            The heading for Doctrine and Covenants 132 includes the following:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “Although the revelation was recorded in 1843, evidence indicates that some of the principles involved in
            this revelation were known by the Prophet as early as 1831.”
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            The church’s essay on polygamy in Kirtland and Nauvoo also states this idea:
        </p>

        <!-- Needs quotation -->
        <blockquote>
            “The revelation on plural marriage was not written down until 1843, but its early verses suggest that part
            of it emerged from Joseph Smith’s study of the Old Testament in 1831. People who knew Joseph well later
            stated he received the revelation about that time.”
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            There is one big reason that the church wants to pin polygamy to 1831 and that is his affair with Fanny
            Alger. We will cover that more below, but it’s important to note here because the history behind the 1831
            revelation is not helpful to the church’s case.
            <br><br>
            The “people who knew Joseph well” referred to here are W.W. Phelps, Oliver Cowdery and five other men who
            received instruction for their mission to the ‘Indians’ to take additional wives to make the Indians whiter.
            From the claimed revelation:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “[I]t is my will, that in time, ye should take unto you wives of the Lamanites and Nephites, <strong>that
                their
                posterity may become white, delightsome, and Just</strong>, for even now their females are more virtuous
            than the
            gentiles.” (W.W. Phelps, 1831)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            W.W. Phelps was a friendly source, and we also have an antagonistic source that confirms that Joseph Smith
            claimed a revelation from God that they should marry the Native Americas, who Joseph Smith labeled as
            Lamanites in claimed revelations from God. From Ezra Booth:
        </p>

        <!-- Needs quotation -->
        <blockquote>
            “...it has been made known by revelation, that it will be pleasing to the Lord, should they form a
            matrimonial alliance with the natives; and by this means the Elders, who comply with the thing so pleasing
            to the Lord, and for which the Lord has promised to bless those who do it abundantly, gain a residence in
            the Indian territory, independent of the agent....” (Ohio Star, December 8, 1831)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This revelation was probably not mentioned specifically in the church’s Gospel Topics essay because of its
            racist overtones and contradiction to the instructions in D&C 132. I want to again point out this line from
            W.W. Phelps:
        </p>

        <!-- Needs quotation -->
        <blockquote>
            “ye should take unto you wives of the Lamanites and Nephites, that their posterity may become white,
            delightsome, and Just.”
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            As we discussed in our overview on DNA and the Book of Mormon, the teaching of the Book of Mormon was that
            the Native Americans were cursed with a dark skin for their wickedness, and if they came back to Christ,
            their skin would again turn ‘white and delightsome.’ This claimed revelation from God has Joseph Smith
            teaching this concept again, with the idea that if the more righteous leaders of the church have sex and
            procreate with the Native Americans, that their children would become whiter.
            <br><br>
            This is the harm that is caused from an incorrect teaching such as the premise of the Book of Mormon, where
            Native Americans are given a history and identity that is simply not true. While it is true that children of
            Native Americans would look whiter if they have a child with a white settler, it is not because the child is
            “white, delightsome, and just,” but because that child would have DNA from the white father.
            <br><br>
            The one other reference we have to Joseph Smith speaking about polygamy in 1831 is another one the church
            does not want to bring up. Mary Elizabeth Rollins Lightner, who is famous in church history for protecting
            the copies of the Book of Commandments against the mob in Missouri, was later a polyandrous wife of Joseph
            Smith. She gives this account of her introduction to polygamy:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            Mary Elizabeth Rollins Lightner: "[At age 12 in 1831], [Smith] told me about his great vision concerning me.
            He said I was the first woman God commanded him to take as a plural wife. … In 1834 he was commanded to take
            me for a Wife …. [In 1842 I] went forward and was sealed to him. Brigham Young performed the sealing … for
            time, and all Eternity. I did just as Joseph told me to do." (Compton, Todd (1997), In Sacred Loneliness:
            The Plural Wives of Joseph Smith)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            To be clear, I do not believe that Joseph Smith was telling Mary at the age of 12 that he was going to take
            her for a wife. Many stories in church history are altered and embellished to become faith promoting and, in
            some cases, self-serving, and there is absolutely no reason to believe Joseph Smith was thinking of polygamy
            at this point, let alone with a 12 year old girl.
            <br><br>
            That said, this is another data point that shows Joseph Smith was thinking about polygamy in 1831, but it is
            not one the church is wanting to reference. While we will see later that Joseph Smith does marry two 14 year
            old girls, the idea that he is grooming a 12 year old girl to become a polyandrous wife makes no sense –
            especially given that Mary Elizabeth Rollins Lightner would marry Adam Lightner in 1835. If she was told in
            1831 that she was commanded by God to become a polygamous wife of Joseph Smith and did not appear to have
            any reservations about that declaration, then why would she marry another guy? As we will see with Fanny
            Alger, a lot of these late additions to the story don’t make a lot of sense.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Joseph Smith’s Relationship with Fanny Alger
        </h2>

        <p>
            As stated above, a key reason that the church wants to push the polygamy revelation back to 1831 is because
            just a few years later Joseph Smith will be caught in a scandalous relationship with Fanny Alger. Although
            no precise records exist, it is believed that around 1833 the then 27 year old Joseph Smith would engage in
            a sexual relationship with 16 year old Fanny Alger, who was a live-in maid at the Smith’s household.
            <br><br>
            The church’s essay contends the following:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “Fragmentary evidence suggests that Joseph Smith acted on the angel’s first command by marrying a plural
            wife, Fanny Alger, in Kirtland, Ohio, in the mid-1830s. Several Latter-day Saints who had lived in Kirtland
            reported decades later that Joseph Smith had married Alger, who lived and worked in the Smith household,
            after he had obtained her consent and that of her parents.”
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            First, there is no record of the marriage. This is important to note, because the account that the church
            cites to declare that this was a marriage is the following from Mosiah Hancock, a second hand source to his
            father Levi:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “Therefore Brother Joseph said ‘Brother Levi <strong>I want to make a bargain with you – If you will get
                Fanny Alger
                for me for a wife you may have Clarissa Reed. I love Fanny.</strong>' ‘I will' Said Father. ‘Go brother
            Levi and the
            Lord will prosper you' Said Joseph… Father goes to Fanny and said ‘Fanny Brother Joseph the Prophet loves
            you and wishes you for a wife will you be his wife?' ‘I will Levi' Said She – Father takes Fanny to Joseph
            and said ‘Brother Joseph I have been successful in my mission' – Father gave her to Joseph repeating the
            Ceremony as Joseph repeated to him.” (Mosiah Hancock Autobiography, pp. 62-63)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            I want to state up front, as reflected in Mary Elizabeth Rollins Lightner’s quote above, that I do not
            believe Joseph Smith and Fanny Alger were married. There is no contemporary evidence, and the only account
            is a secondhand quote made 36 years after the relationship occurred. Furthermore, this quote dates to
            1869—after polygamy was well established in the church—when there was significant motivation to link the
            Fanny Alger relationship to early polygamy, both to support Joseph Smith’s reputation and to authenticate
            the practice of polygamy. Following the split with the RLDS, the Brighamite branch (today’s LDS Church)
            needed to establish Joseph as a polygamist to assert their authority as his true successors.
            <br><br>
            If the church chooses to use this source to argue for a marriage between Joseph and Fanny, they must also
            explain Joseph’s own words about Fanny, used here as a 'bargaining chip' for Levi Hancock’s marriage. It may
            sound harsh, but consider this line attributed to Joseph Smith: “Brother Levi I want to make a bargain with
            you – If you will get Fanny Alger for me for a wife you may have Clarissa Reed. I love Fanny.”
            <br><br>
            To accept this account, one would have to believe that 27-year-old Joseph Smith fell in love with his
            16-year-old live-in maid—contradicting the idea that any potential marriage was solely commanded by God.
            Joseph then apparently leveraged Levi Hancock’s love for Clarissa Reed as a “bargain” to persuade Levi to
            help him pursue Fanny. Even if one considers this a marriage, the details are troubling.
            <br><br>
            The Fanny Alger relationship created significant conflict for Joseph, including Emma Smith’s decision to
            expel Fanny from their home. Oliver Cowdery described it as follows:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “A dirty, nasty, filthy affair of his and Fanny Alger's was talked over in which I strictly declared that I
            had never deserted from the truth in the matter, and as I supposed was admitted by himself.” (Bushman, Rough
            Stone Rolling, p. 323)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This extramarital relationship played a major role in Oliver Cowdery’s eventual excommunication. It also led
            to Emma forcing Fanny out of the household.
            <br><br>
            The church’s essay states: “After the marriage with Alger ended in separation, Joseph seems to have set the
            subject of plural marriage aside until after the Church moved to Nauvoo, Illinois.”
            <br><br>
            However, the essay omits that the relationship (without any documented marriage despite the church’s claim)
            “ended in separation” because Emma expelled Fanny from the house. William McLellin, an early church member
            often considered a controversial source, told Joseph Smith’s son, Joseph Smith III:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “Again I told her [Emma] I heard that one night she missed Joseph and Fanny Alger. She went to the barn and
            saw him and Fanny in the barn together alone. She looked through a crack and saw the transaction!! She told
            me this story too was verily true.” (Compton, In Sacred Loneliness, p. 35)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            After Emma discovered the nature of the relationship, she dismissed Fanny from their home. Ann Eliza Webb
            Young recounts:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            Emma “had turned Fanny out of the house in the night…By degrees it became whispered about that Joseph’s love
            for his adopted daughter was by no means a paternal affection, and his wife, discovering the fact, at once
            took measures to place the girl beyond his reach. Angered at finding the two persons whom most she loved
            playing such a treacherous part towards her, she by no means spared her reproaches, and, finally, the storm
            became so furious, that Joseph was obliged to send, at midnight, for Oliver Cowdery, his scribe, to come and
            endeavor to settle matters between them.” (Young, Wife Number 19: Or The Story of a Life in Bondage, Being a
            Complete Exposé of Mormonism, And Revealing the Sorrows, Sacrifices and Sufferings of Women in Polygamy, p.
            66)
        </blockquote>


        <p>
            Though Ann Eliza Webb Young later became critical of the church after her marriage to Brigham Young, she had
            direct knowledge of this event, as Fanny was sent back to her parents following her expulsion. Ann’s father,
            Chauncey Webb, also commented on the incident:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “Emma was furious, and drove the girl, who was unable to conceal the consequences of her celestial relation
            with the prophet, out of her house.” (Wyl, Wilhelm. “Mormon portraits: or the Truth About the Mormon
            Leaders, 1830-1866” p. 57)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            In many of Joseph Smith’s later polygamous and polyandrous marriages, he engaged in relationships unknown to
            Emma, who actively opposed polygamy in her work with the Relief Society. Yet some of her closest friends
            were secretly married to Joseph. This dynamic may be uncomfortable, but it reflects historical facts we need
            to address.
            <br><br>
            Lastly, whether or not this was a marriage, it was not a “legal” relationship. Any marriage to Fanny Alger
            would have been illegal by law, and even more crucial for the church, because Joseph had not claimed the
            sealing keys at this point, it would not be a valid marriage in the eyes of God. As Oliver Cowdery, who
            would know if Joseph had sealing authority, believed, if it was not a marriage, it was simply an affair.
            Whichever perspective one takes, it occurred behind Emma’s back.
            <br><br>
            Fanny Alger’s case is critical because the relationship, whether marriage or affair, predates Joseph Smith’s
            claim to sealing keys. Beyond the technical illegality of any marriage, Joseph’s lack of authority to
            perform sealings at this time makes this relationship highly problematic. We will examine further
            relationships as we continue.
        </p>

        <h2>The 1835 Statement on Polygamy in the Doctrine and Covenants</h2>

        <p>
            Following the Fanny Alger relationship, Joseph Smith went on a trip to Michigan. When he was away, the
            church wrote the following ‘article on marriage’ which would be added to the Doctrine and Covenants in 1835:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “Inasmuch as this church of Christ has been reproached with the crime of fornication, and polygamy: we
            declare that we believe, that one man should have one wife; and one woman, but one husband, except in case
            of death, when either is at liberty to marry again.”
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This statement wouldn’t be included in the Doctrine and Covenants unless rumors about Joseph Smith’s
            relationships outside his marriage to Emma were widespread. Todd Compton, a faithful member and author of In
            Sacred Loneliness, remarked that:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “clearly the statement represented an effort to counteract scandal and perhaps to defuse rumors of Fanny
            Alger’s marriage, possible pregnancy, and expulsion.” (Compton, In Sacred Loneliness, p. 36)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Although there is no direct evidence that Fanny Alger was pregnant when she was asked to leave the Smith
            home, this notion aligns with Chauncey Webb's account, which states that Fanny Alger “was unable to conceal
            the consequences of her celestial relation with the prophet” (Wyl, Wilhelm, Mormon Portraits: or the Truth
            About the Mormon Leaders, 1830-1866, p. 57).

            Some apologists point out that Joseph Smith didn’t personally write the article on marriage, which is
            accurate. However, he did insert the statement into the 1835 Doctrine and Covenants and later oversaw its
            publication in Times and Seasons when polygamy was gaining momentum. Thus, even if he wasn’t the original
            author, Joseph Smith’s involvement with the statement is undeniable.
        </p>

        <h2>The 1836 Vision and the Restoration of the Priesthood Keys</h2>

        <p>
            As previously mentioned, when Joseph Smith claimed in 1831 that leaders should marry Native Americans to
            make their posterity “white, just, and delightsome,” he had not yet introduced the concept of sealing keys.
            The same holds true for his relationship with Fanny Alger.
            <br><br>
            This brings us to the 1836 vision in the Kirtland Temple, where Joseph Smith claimed to receive the
            priesthood keys—later interpreted to include sealing keys. Known now as D&C 110, this vision was a shared
            experience between Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery.
            <br><br>
            As I noted in the priesthood restoration overview, it’s important to recognize that Joseph Smith reported
            visits from both Elias and Elijah during this vision, though they are the same individual with different
            names in translation. This raises questions about the vision itself, though it’s not the main issue
            regarding polygamy.
            <br><br>
            The church generally links this vision to the restoration of the sealing keys, yet a reading of D&C 110
            shows no mention of sealings, eternal marriage, polygamy, or celestial marriage. The concept of “keys”
            appears here in a general sense, later adapted by the church to fit Joseph Smith’s evolving theology. The
            church’s essay on polygamy explains:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “The sealing of husband and wife for eternity was made possible by the restoration of priesthood keys and
            ordinances. On April 3, 1836, the Old Testament prophet Elijah appeared to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery
            in the Kirtland Temple and restored the priesthood keys necessary to perform ordinances for the living and
            the dead, including sealing families together.”
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            There is no way Fanny Alger’s relationship could have constituted a marriage with proper sealing keys, nor
            could Joseph Smith’s 1831 revelation be connected to the Kirtland vision, as the concept of sealing had yet
            to be developed in Smith’s theology.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Joseph Smith’s 1841 Teaching on <em>No Sin if No Accuser</em>
        </h2>

        <p>
            As Joseph Smith was preparing to practice polygamy in late 1841, he introduced a teaching that he recorded
            in his journal. On November 7, 1841, he stated:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “I charged the Saints not to follow the example of the adversary in accusing the brethren, and said “if you
            do not accuse each other God will not accuse you. If you have no accuser you will enter heaven; and if you
            will follow the Revelations and instructions which God gives you through me, I will take you into heaven as
            my back load. If you will not accuse me, I will not accuse you. If you will throw a cloak of charity over my
            sins, I will over yours— for charity covereth a multitude of sins. What many people call sin is not sin; I
            do many things to break down superstition, and I will break it down:” (<a
                href="https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/history-1838-1856-volume-c-1-addenda/20"
                target="_blank"><em></em>History, 1838–1856, volume C-1
                Addenda</a>)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This teaching is particularly intriguing in light of the rumors that had followed Joseph Smith since his
            relationship with Fanny Alger, which had sparked accusations of infidelity. Now, with the practice of
            polygamy beginning, these rumors were only set to grow.
            <br><br>
            Here, Joseph explicitly states that if members of the church do not accuse him of sins, he will not accuse
            them of theirs. Effectively, he reframes sin, encouraging members to “throw a cloak of charity” over his
            actions. This teaching bypasses traditional notions of accountability, suggesting that a lack of accusation
            alone can lead one to heaven—a notion that could discourage individuals from speaking out and instead binds
            them in a sort of mutual silence.
            <br><br>
            Joseph further asserts his authority by saying, <em>“if you will follow the Revelations and instructions
                which
                God gives you through me, I will take you into heaven as my back load,”</em> This reinforces that his
            words carry
            divine authority, a concept we see again as he makes proposals to various women. This notion will be
            significant as we examine Joseph Smith’s “Happiness Letter” to Nancy Rigdon, where similar ideas were used
            to pressure young women into marriage.

            These tactics are not unique to Joseph Smith; other leaders, including David Berg, David Koresh, and Warren
            Jeffs, have also claimed divine approval for their actions. Joseph’s emphasis on secrecy and his position as
            a prophet allowed him to leverage his authority and discourage accusations of adultery, as had been voiced
            by Oliver Cowdery regarding his relationship with Fanny Alger.

        <h2>
            Joseph Smith’s Proposals to Polygamous and Polyandrous Wives
        </h2>

        <p>
            It’s challenging to present the history of polygamy chronologically, but before we discuss D&C 132, it’s
            helpful to consider how Joseph Smith practiced polygamy before the revelation was recorded.
        </p>

        <p>
            One significant aspect of Joseph’s practice involved polyandry—marrying women who were already legally
            married to other men. The church acknowledges this in its essay on plural marriage:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “Following his marriage to Louisa Beaman and before he married other single women, Joseph Smith was sealed
            to a number of women who were already married.”
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            While the essay doesn’t provide details, historian Todd Compton estimates that eleven of Joseph Smith’s
            wives were polyandrous, with nine out of his first twelve marriages involving already-married women
            (Compton, In Sacred Loneliness). In the essay, the church explains:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “There are several possible explanations for this practice. These sealings may have provided a way to create
            an eternal bond or link between Joseph’s family and other families within the Church… Joseph Smith’s
            sealings to women already married may have been an early version of linking one family to another. In
            Nauvoo, most if not all of the first husbands seem to have continued living in the same household with their
            wives during Joseph’s lifetime, and complaints about these sealings with Joseph Smith are virtually absent
            from the documentary record.”
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            The church offers some explanations, suggesting that these sealings created “an eternal bond or link”
            between Joseph’s family and others in the church. However, if this were the only purpose, Joseph could have
            sealed himself to one woman per family or performed non-marital sealings with men. Additionally, the Law of
            Adoption, which Joseph occasionally practiced, allowed men to be sealed as adopted sons. So why choose wives
            and young women, instead of allowing these women to marry partners closer to their own age?
            <br><br>
            This argument weakens further when we consider Joseph’s marriages to multiple women within the same family,
            including pairs of sisters and mothers and daughters. Such arrangements suggest purposes beyond simple
            kinship bonding, especially considering that some of these relationships were shrouded in secrecy and
            involved the need to “burn letters” after reading.
            <br><br>
            If the sole purpose of these marriages were indeed noble and virtuous, transparency would have been
            possible. Joseph could have explained the practice openly, avoiding secrecy and lying. Legal non-romantic
            sealings between families would not have required deception, nor would they have caused such distress to
            families and young women.
            <br><br>
            The church also notes that “complaints about these sealings with Joseph Smith are virtually absent from the
            documentary record.” However, records do exist of individuals who rejected Joseph’s proposals, such as Orson
            Pratt, Albert Smith, William Law, and Hiram Kimball. Accounts of polyandrous marriages, such as those of
            Zina Huntington and her husband Henry Jacobs, also reveal the impact of these relationships on those
            involved.
            <br><br>
            As we proceed, we’ll examine these relationships in greater detail, drawing on both supportive and critical
            sources to understand this complex chapter of church history.
            <br><br>
            Back to the essay:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “These sealings may also be explained by Joseph’s reluctance to enter plural marriage because of the sorrow
            it would bring to his wife Emma. He may have believed that sealings to married women would comply with the
            Lord’s command without requiring him to have normal marriage relationships. This could explain why,
            according to Lorenzo Snow, the angel reprimanded Joseph for having “demurred” on plural marriage even after
            he had entered into the practice. After this rebuke, according to this interpretation, Joseph returned
            primarily to sealings with single women.”
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            What is interesting here is that the church wants to portray the Fanny Alger relationship as a marriage
            because it included sex, but they then turn around here to say that Joseph Smith avoided sex to save his
            (first) wife Emma the sorrow polygamy would bring her. The problem is that Joseph Smith was having sex with
            other women at this time, and I’m not sure how much sorrow would be spared for Emma knowing that he wasn’t
            having sex with every one of them.
            <br><br>
            To be clear, while we do not have great records of the polyandrous marriages, we do have indications that he
            had sex with at least one of them. According to Todd Compton, one of Joseph Smith’s polyandrous wives,
            Sylvia Sessions, told her daughter that she was the child of Joseph Smith. This is exemplified by the fact
            that Sylvia named her daughter Josephine.
            <br><br>
            We will get to the ‘angel with a drawn sword’ later in these overviews, but the entire idea is used by
            Joseph Smith to get more women to accept his proposals, which makes this comparison more wishful thinking
            than based in the reality of what Joseph Smith was doing. The essay above is stating that the angel wasn’t
            happy with just marrying the women, but that Joseph had to have sex with them or else would be slain with a
            drawn sword. I’ll get back to this later, but for now, back to the essay:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “Another possibility is that, in an era when life spans were shorter than they are today, faithful women
            felt an urgency to be sealed by priesthood authority. Several of these women were married either to
            non-Mormons or former Mormons, and more than one of the women later expressed unhappiness in their present
            marriages. Living in a time when divorce was difficult to obtain, these women may have believed a sealing to
            Joseph Smith would give them blessings they might not otherwise receive in the next life.”
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This paragraph presents a significant issue: the church frames polyandry as though Joseph Smith is rescuing
            women from difficult situations. In reality, many of these women were married to faithful, active church
            members. In fact, only three of Joseph Smith's polyandrous wives were not married to members of the church.
            Some were even married to church leaders, including one who was married to an apostle.
            <br><br>
            Furthermore, justifying Joseph Smith’s polyandry by stating that “more than one of the women later expressed
            unhappiness in their present marriage” is troubling. Even if we take this claim at face value, it suggests
            that Joseph Smith might have exploited the vulnerabilities of women in unhappy relationships. This does not
            make polygamy appear virtuous; instead, it suggests that Joseph Smith may have deliberately chosen
            vulnerable women to approach for marriage, a pattern I will elaborate on in the next overview.
            <br><br>
            This practice also directly contradicts D&C 132, which states that these men are to “espouse virgins” only.
            Later in this overview, I will detail the various ways Joseph Smith violated the very revelation he himself
            dictated. This discussion will also provide a useful context for understanding how D&C 132 was produced.
            <br><br>
            There is much speculation as to why Joseph Smith’s early polyandrous marriages were almost exclusively with
            married women, with one plausible explanation being the ease of concealing any unexpected pregnancies. After
            his experience with Fanny Alger, Joseph Smith learned the critical importance of secrecy. If any of his
            polyandrous wives were to become pregnant, the risk of scandal would be easier to manage.
        </p>

        <h2>The Production of Doctrine and Covenants 132</h2>

        <p>
            There is so much history the occurs between Fanny Alger and when D&C 132 was produced, but I want to quickly
            cover D&C 132 here because I feel it is important to understanding how Joseph Smith produced revelation.
            This revelation was first written down on July 12, 1843, and was dictated to William Clayton as the request
            of Joseph’s brother, Hyrum Smith.
            <br><br>
            Hyrum Smith wanted Joseph to produce this revelation as Hyrum had been convinced of the idea of polygamy,
            and believed that he could convince Joseph’s first wife Emma of the principal if it was written in the voice
            of God. The church has the narrative of this event in their book Saints:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            "On the morning of July 12, William Clayton was in Joseph’s office when the prophet and Hyrum entered. “If
            you will write the revelation,” Hyrum told Joseph, “I will take and read it to Emma, and I believe I can
            convince her of its truth, and you will hereafter have peace.”
            <br><br>
            “You do not know Emma as well as I do,” Joseph said. That spring and summer, he had been sealed to
            additional women, including a few whom Emma had personally selected. Yet helping Joseph choose wives had not
            made obeying the principle easy for Emma.
            <br><br>
            “The doctrine is so plain,” Hyrum said. “I can convince any reasonable man or woman of its truth, purity,
            and heavenly origin.”
            <br><br>
            “We will see,” Joseph said. He asked William to take out paper and write as he spoke the word of the Lord.
            <br><br>
            Much of the revelation was already known to Joseph. It described the new and everlasting covenant of eternal
            marriage, along with associated blessings and promises. It also revealed the terms governing plural
            marriage, which Joseph had learned while translating the Bible in 1831. The remainder of the revelation was
            new counsel for him and Emma, addressing their questions and current struggles with plural marriage."
            (Saints, Volume 1)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            As noted earlier, Joseph Smith’s statements in 1831 significantly differ from events in Nauvoo. In 1831, he
            spoke about marrying Lamanite women to make their posterity “white, delightsome, and just,” language derived
            from the Book of Mormon, which claims that Native Americans could be made "white" by conversion to Christ.
            This teaching, now understood as scientifically flawed and racist, is why neither Saints nor the official
            essay explain that 1831 revelation, as it relies on outdated beliefs from the Book of Mormon and Smith’s
            early revelations.
            <br><br>
            Another critical omission from Saints is that, by this time, Joseph Smith had already married about 20 other
            women, with Emma unaware of most. Saints mentions “including a few whom Emma had personally selected,” but
            omits that Emma chose four women for Smith to marry, two of whom, sisters Emily and Eliza Partridge, he had
            already married.
            <br><br>
            Emily and Eliza Partridge lived in the Smith household after their father Edward’s death in May 1840. Joseph
            married them in March 1843, two months before Emma selected them as wives for him, leading him to conduct a
            "mock wedding" with the sisters to avoid disclosing to Emma that he was already married to, and intimate
            with, these women living in their home.
            <br><br>
            We’ll explore these marriages in greater detail, but it’s essential to understand that D&C 132 arose after
            years of Smith deceiving Emma, maintaining secret relationships with other women, many of whom were her
            close friends. I can’t even imagine what that must have felt like for Emma as she began to realize what
            Joseph Smith was doing, and this is why polygamy makes me so upset.
            <br><br>
            Hyrum Smith’s request for Joseph to dictate what is now known as D&C 132 is particularly interesting in
            light of earlier revelations, including those in the Book of Mormon. William Clayton, who recorded the
            revelation, noted:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “Hyrum very urgently requested Joseph to write the revelation by means of the Urim and Thummim, but Joseph,
            in reply, said he did not need to, for he knew the revelation perfectly from beginning to end.” (History of
            the Church)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Hyrum requested that Joseph use the Urim and Thummim (or seer stone) to ensure the revelation was directly
            from God. Instead, Joseph claimed he didn’t need it because he knew the revelation by heart. D&C 132 is over
            3,200 words long, so it’s improbable that anyone could memorize it verbatim. By Joseph’s account, this
            revelation had been given years earlier but not documented.
            <br><br>
            As mentioned in the Book of Mormon authorship overview, a typical scribe could write about 1,200 words per
            hour, meaning that dictating D&C 132 would take the equivalent of a full day’s work—yet Joseph did this
            without any source material or a seer stone.
            <br><br>
            The revelation is written in a style reminiscent of the King James Bible, mirroring other revelations with
            phrases like “I am the Lord thy God” and “Behold, I am Alpha and Omega.” Comparing this revelation to
            Joseph’s initial 1832 First Vision account reveals his skill in switching from everyday speech to a divine
            “voice of God,” even while dictating.
            <br><br>
            Given that Hyrum requested the revelation to convince Emma, the text’s tone and emphasis make sense. Much of
            the revelation justifies Joseph’s actions and threatens to “destroy” Emma if she does not comply. While
            apologists might argue Joseph received these instructions years prior, the absence of any earlier record,
            despite his documenting numerous other revelations, lends credence to critics’ arguments that he invoked the
            “voice of God” to assert authority or validate his actions.
            <br><br>
            Notably, D&C 132 appears to have been given before Joseph entered polygamy, yet the portion directed at Emma
            reads as if it responds to her recent awareness of his additional wives. From D&C 132:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            Verily, I say unto you: A commandment I give unto mine handmaid, Emma Smith, your wife, whom I have given
            unto you, that she stay herself and partake not of that which I commanded you to offer unto her; for I did
            it, saith the Lord, to prove you all, as I did Abraham, and that I might require an offering at your hand,
            by covenant and sacrifice. (<a
                href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132?lang=eng"
                target="_blank">Doctrine and Covenants. <em>Section 132:51</em></a>)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            What Joseph “offered” Emma remains unclear. Critics refer to a journal entry by William Clayton, written
            shortly before D&C 132’s dictation, which states:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            "This A.M. President Joseph took me and conversed considerable concerning some delicate matters. Said [Emma]
            wanted to lay a snare for me. He told me last night of this and said he had felt troubled. He said [Emma]
            had treated him coldly and badly since I came…and he knew she was disposed to be revenged on him for some
            things. <strong>She thought that if he would indulge himself she would too."</strong> (William Clayton
            Journal, June 23,
            1843)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Apologists suggest Joseph might have offered Emma a divorce, as FAIR notes:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            "Some have seen this as Emma claiming she would practice plural marriage (a strange idea, given how she felt
            about it), and these readers have then extended the reading to include a belief that she was threatening to
            marry William Law. Others have seen these verses (perhaps more plausibly) as Emma simply threatening divorce
            if Joseph didn't cease plural marriage."
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            However, critics argue that Emma proposed taking another husband if Joseph had multiple wives, citing
            Clayton’s record: “She thought that if he would indulge himself she would too.” D&C 132 frames the offer as
            an “Abrahamic test” for Emma to “partake not of,” which seems inconsistent with a divorce proposal.
            <br><br>
            Joseph claimed to know this revelation perfectly, though it references what seems like a recent offer to
            Emma. The fact that he did not use the Urim and Thummim raises questions about how he knew to include this
            clause. This passage suggests he tailored the revelation for Emma as he dictated it, knowing Hyrum would
            bring it to her.
            <br><br>
            This might also explain the revelation’s harsh language, which includes threats of destruction if Emma did
            not comply: “But if she will not abide this commandment she shall be destroyed, saith the Lord; for I am the
            Lord thy God, and will destroy her if she abide not in my law.”
            <br><br>
            Apologists might view this as a generalized command, unrelated to polygamy, yet it’s striking that God would
            demand Emma forgive Joseph “his trespasses” in a revelation supposedly given before he took additional
            wives: "And again, verily I say, let mine handmaid forgive my servant Joseph his trespasses; and then shall
            she be forgiven her trespasses, wherein she has trespassed against me."
            <br><br>
            Joseph’s revelations frequently address his immediate issues, such as pressuring Martin Harris to sell
            property, ordering the destruction of Hiram Page’s seer stone, or explaining why he could not recreate the
            first 116 pages by divine command.
            <br><br>
            Given Joseph’s willingness to dictate in a scriptural voice, these “revelations” often appear to serve his
            personal needs. If one accepts that D&C 132 was self-authored, it explains why the justification for
            polygamy feels flawed. In D&C 132, God allegedly tells Joseph why He “ justified my servants Abraham, Isaac,
            and Jacob, as also Moses, David and Solomon, my servants, as touching the principle and doctrine of their
            having many wives and concubines"
            <br><br>
            However, Abraham was never commanded to take a second wife, and the Book of Mormon condemns David and
            Solomon’s polygamy as “abominable.” Such contradictions trouble critics because it seems implausible that
            God would so directly contradict earlier scriptures. Yet, considering D&C 132 in light of Clayton’s journal
            entries during the dictation offers insight into the broader complexities within Joseph Smith’s work.
        </p>

        <h2>Problems with Joseph Smith’s Revelation on Polygamy/Plural Marriage
        </h2>

        <p>
            Before we get to the different accounts of how Joseph Smith implemented the practice of polygamy, I want to
            highlight some of the areas of D&C 132 that are highly problematic, and look at the church’s apologetics
            behind them. This is important because in many instances Joseph Smith will violate the rules of D&C 132 in
            his polygamous marriages.
            <br><br>
            As a member we never really spoke about D&C 132 outside of cherry picking a few verses that are now
            redefined to separate polygamy from the idea of celestial marriage. The problem is that if you read D&C 132
            all the way through, it is a deeply troubling revelation that really shows just how abusive polygamy was and
            how inconsistent and incorrect the author of the revelation was in producing it.
        </p>

        <h3>Warnings and Threats to Emma Smith</h3>

        <p>
            We have to remember that this revelation was written to Emma Smith. I’m not sure if Joseph Smith ever
            intended this revelation to be used in the Doctrine and Covenants, but it is was clearly written to persuade
            Emma Smith to accept Joseph Smith’s polygamy by threatening her exaltation if she did not.
            <br><br>
            First, how the church’s essay frames it:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “In the summer of 1843, Joseph Smith dictated the revelation on marriage, a lengthy and complex text
            containing both glorious promises and stern warnings,<strong>some directed at Emma.</strong>”
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            The reality is that pretty much all of the warnings were direct at Emma. In fact, D&C 132 has 11 warnings
            included in it. I’m including them below with super quick commentary on each:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            4 For behold, I reveal unto you a new and an everlasting covenant; and if ye abide not that covenant, then
            are ye damned; for no one can reject this covenant and be permitted to enter into my glory.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This is a threat directed at Emma in just the fourth verse, that if she does not abide by the revelation
            Joseph Smith is dictating, she will be damned.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            6 And as pertaining to the new and everlasting covenant, it was instituted for the fulness of my glory; and
            he that receiveth a fulness thereof must and shall abide the law, or he shall be damned, saith the Lord God.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This threat is to Joseph Smith, but it really is again targeted at Emma. Basically this is stating that if
            Joseph Smith does not follow through with polygamy, he will be damned. Telling this to Emma puts additional
            pressure on her to accept the practice, just as the ‘angel with a drawn sword’ story is designed to put
            immense pressure on the young women being proposed to by Joseph.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            51 Verily, I say unto you: A commandment I give unto mine handmaid, Emma Smith, your wife, whom I have given
            unto you, that she stay herself and partake not of that which I commanded you to offer unto her; for I did
            it, saith the Lord, to prove you all, as I did Abraham, and that I might require an offering at your hand,
            by covenant and sacrifice.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This is a threat directly at Emma Smith that she should “partake not of that which I commanded you to offer
            unto her.” There is speculation as to what that offer was as noted above, with some accounts that it was an
            offer to let Emma Smith have another man, and some apologists contend it might have been an offer for
            divorce. Whatever the reason, Joseph Smith here is rescinding the offer within this revelation under the
            premise of a commandment from God.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            52 And let mine handmaid, Emma Smith, receive all those that have been given unto my servant Joseph, and who
            are virtuous and pure before me; and those who are not pure, and have said they were pure, shall be
            destroyed, saith the Lord God.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This is a threat that is not pointed at Emma or indirectly at her through Joseph, but one that is stating
            that any of Joseph Smith’s polygamous or polyandrous wives that claimed to be pure but are not pure will be
            destroyed. I’m not sure why this will be of much comfort to Emma Smith, but I suppose this is Joseph Smith’s
            way of saying that he’s only going to marry and have sex with the purest of women.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            54 And I command mine handmaid, Emma Smith, to abide and cleave unto my servant Joseph, and to none else.
            But if she will not abide this commandment she shall be destroyed, saith the Lord; for I am the Lord thy
            God, and will destroy her if she abide not in my law.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This is the most famous of the direct threats to Emma Smith, with Joseph Smith telling his wife in the voice
            of God that she will be destroyed if she does not abide in the new and everlasting covenant, which was
            without question considered to be polygamy at this time.
            <br><br>
            I want to make this point right now: If the “new and everlasting covenant” was merely celestial marriage as
            the church today wants to claim, there would be no need to threaten Emma’s exaltation if she did not abide
            by it. Every early leader absolutely believed the “new and everlasting covenant” was plural
            marriage/polygamy including Joseph Smith, and all of the apologetics trying to redefine the phrase only
            comes out of necessity.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            55 But if she will not abide this commandment, then shall my servant Joseph do all things for her, even as
            he hath said; and I will bless him and multiply him and give unto him an hundred-fold in this world, of
            fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters, houses and lands, wives and children, and crowns of eternal lives
            in the eternal worlds.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This is not a threat on Emma’s life or exaltation as the last verse, but it is a threat that tells Emma
            either she starts allowing Joseph Smith to take extra wives with sexual relations, or God is going to give
            him “an hundred-fold in this world.”
            The irony here is that Joseph Smith is already married to about 20 women at this point, many of whom are
            Emma’s friends. So this might have been a much better commandment before he started marrying wives behind
            Emma’s back.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            56 And again, verily I say, let mine handmaid forgive my servant Joseph his trespasses; and then shall she
            be forgiven her trespasses, wherein she has trespassed against me; and I, the Lord thy God, will bless her,
            and multiply her, and make her heart to rejoice.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Again, this commandment is a threat to Emma that if she does not forgive Joseph Smith for marrying and
            having sex with other women behind her back, her unrelated sins will not be forgiven. When you realize this
            is being written off the cuff by Joseph Smith, this makes a lot more sense, because you wouldn’t think God
            would withhold forgiveness of Emma’s sins until she is on board with her husband having sex with almost at
            least a dozen women behind her back.
            <br><br>
            This also ties into the 1841 teachings above, where Joseph Smith states that if he is not accused of sin, he
            will not accuse anyone else of sin. In other words, if Emma plays along here, Joseph Smith says that God
            will also play along and forgive her sins.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            57 And again, I say, let not my servant Joseph put his property out of his hands, lest an enemy come and
            destroy him; for Satan seeketh to destroy; for I am the Lord thy God, and he is my servant; and behold, and
            lo, I am with him, as I was with Abraham, thy father, even unto his exaltation and glory.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This is a fascinating verse because on the very same day that D&C 132 was recorded, July 12, 1843, Joseph
            Smith wrote a deed to Emma Smith for property and money in Nauvoo. You can see the deed at the Joseph Smith
            Papers Project, but it’s fascinating that on the same day that Joseph Smith writes a warning to “let not my
            servant Joseph put his property out of his hands,” Emma Smith is awarded property by Joseph Smith.
            <br><br>
            It would appear this is part of what Emma Smith wanted to accept what Joseph Smith was doing, and she
            absolutely got it against Joseph Smith’s wishes in D&C 132 that she not take it. And it’s a lot of property
            as well. It looks like a word salad the deed so feel free to skip the following quote, but from the deed:

        <p>
            As I said, it is fascinating to see on the same day that Joseph Smith commands Emma not to take property
            from Joseph Smith that she takes quite a bit of property from Joseph Smith. This is also another example
            where Joseph Smith is writing revelations that are very concerned with Joseph Smith’s money, property, and
            authority.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            63 But if one or either of the ten virgins, after she is espoused, shall be with another man, she has
            committed adultery, and shall be destroyed…
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This is the second warning that is not directed at Emma Smith, unless the accounts that Emma wanted to have
            another man if Joseph was to continue his relationships with so many women. It certainly would be one way to
            keep her from wanting that, since God is explicitly telling her that women will be destroyed for being with
            another man even as men can be with as many women as they want under the new and everlasting covenant.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            64 And again, verily, verily, I say unto you, if any man have a wife, who holds the keys of this power, and
            he teaches unto her the law of my priesthood, as pertaining to these things, then shall she believe and
            administer unto him, or she shall be destroyed, saith the Lord your God; for I will destroy her; for I will
            magnify my name upon all those who receive and abide in my law.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Again this threat is directed at not just Emma Smith, but any other woman who does not allow her husband to
            marry and have sex with other women. But since this is being written explicitly for Emma, I’m counting this
            as a threat towards her since she would be included in this verse.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            65 Therefore, it shall be lawful in me, if she receive not this law, for him to receive all things
            whatsoever I, the Lord his God, will give unto him, because she did not believe and administer unto him
            according to my word; and she then becomes the transgressor; and he is exempt from the law of Sarah, who
            administered unto Abraham according to the law when I commanded Abraham to take Hagar to wife.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This is again a warning to Emma, telling her that if she does not accept Joseph Smith’s polygamous
            marriages, she becomes the transgressor. In other words, Joseph Smith has written a loophole into D&C 132
            that allows him to marry and have sex with women even if his beloved Emma rejects his proposals, and it
            actually puts the fault from the one entering into these unlawful relationships back to the faithful spouse.
            <br><br>
            It’s pretty stunning that the Law of Sarah, mentioned just four verses earlier, is not only obliterated in
            verse 65, but that D&C 132 labels the woman who does not consent as the ‘transgressor.’ I just can’t believe
            I never read this as a member, because it’s absolutely horrifying.
            <br><br>
            Sorry for the long section here just to detail these warnings contained in D&C 132, but of the 11 threats or
            warnings here, 8 are directed at Emma Smith, two of them are ambiguous or indirectly at Emma Smith, and just
            1 is clearly not directed at her.
            <br><br>
            In other words, when the church states that D&C 132 is a “lengthy and complex text containing both glorious
            promises and stern warnings, some directed at Emma,” they are being willfully misleading. They are almost
            entirely directed at Emma, and they go beyond stern warnings. They are outright threats of destruction if
            she does not accept Joseph Smith’s polygamy.
            <br><br>
            It is very difficult for me to think about Joseph Smith’s “beloved Emma” knowing that her husband is married
            to many women behind her back including those who have lived in their home and her best friends at church.
            This comes years after Joseph Smith was caught in a sexual relationship with Fanny Alger, and Emma’s trust
            is crushed again by her husband’s infidelity. In response, Joseph Smith sends his brother to her with a
            claimed revelation from God stating that she will be destroyed if she does not comply fully and forgive
            Joseph Smith for everything he has put her through.
            <br><br>
            At this point Emma has to either accept Joseph Smith’s claims of revelations, or she has to risk her
            exaltation. Joseph Smith’s claimed revelation also makes clear that until Emma Smith accepts Joseph Smith’s
            polygamy, they will be separated at death. What a horrible position to put his “beloved Emma” in, and all
            the while Joseph Smith has been doing it behind her back anyway.
            <br><br>
            These are the verses that are rarely discussed in the church’s lessons because they are absolutely abhorrent
            in the context of how D&C 132 was produced and the fact that Joseph Smith had already violated almost every
            aspect of the claimed revelation before he even dictated it, and that is what I want to quickly cover next.
        </p>

        <h3>Problems with Polyandrous Marriages and the Text of D&C 132</h3>

        <p>
            As I mentioned above, Joseph Smith engaged in polyandrous marriages, which means that he was marrying women
            who were already married to other men. Of Joseph Smith’s eleven polyandrous wives, eight were married to
            faithful members of the church.
            <br><br>
            The text of D&C 132 presents a few problems for Joseph Smith. First, the text specifically states that the
            man must “espouse a virgin.” From D&C 132:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            61 And again, as pertaining to the law of the priesthood—if any man espouse a virgin, and desire to espouse
            another, and the first give her consent, and if he espouse the second, and they are virgins, and have vowed
            to no other man, then is he justified; he cannot commit adultery for they are given unto him; for he cannot
            commit adultery with that that belongeth unto him and to no one else.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            If Joseph Smith married eleven women who were already married to other men, then he is espousing women who
            are not virgins. This violates D&C 132 right off the bat. Furthermore, the church’s essay goes to great
            lengths to state that “most if not all of the first husbands seem to have continued living in the same
            household with their wives during Joseph’s lifetime.”
            <br><br>
            This becomes a problem with verse 41 of D&C 132, which explicitly states that if a woman marries into
            polygamy under the “new and everlasting covenant” and then has sex with another man, she will be destroyed:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            41 And as ye have asked concerning adultery, verily, verily, I say unto you, if a man receiveth a wife in
            the new and everlasting covenant, and if she be with another man, and I have not appointed unto her by the
            holy anointing, she hath committed adultery and shall be destroyed.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            In other words, Zina Huntington was pregnant when Joseph Smith finally convinced her to marry him. (I will
            write more on her in the next overview) From this point Zina is now in the “new and everlasting covenant”
            with Joseph Smith in a polyandrous marriage, but she lives at home with her civilly legal, but not “new and
            everlasting covenant” husband, Henry Jacobs. According to D&C 132, “if she be with another man (her legal
            husband, Henry Jacobs), and I have not appointed unto her by the holy anointing, she hath committed adultery
            and shall be destroyed.”
            <br><br>
            This is a horrifying part of the revelation, because in this case Joseph Smith is condemning these women to
            be destroyed if they live with their legal and lawful husbands following their “new and everlasting
            covenant” marriage to Joseph Smith.
            <br><br>
            Furthermore, and this is where polyandry goes from awful to abominable, in a polyandrous marriage the
            children of the wife are sealed to the husband in the “new and everlasting covenant.” In other words, when
            Joseph Smith married Zina Huntington Jacobs, who was pregnant with her legal husband Henry’s child, the
            moment she entered into a polyandrous relationship with Joseph Smith, her child was then sealed to Zina and
            Joseph – not to that child’s actual father, Henry.
            <br><br>
            As I said at the beginning, polygamy is an area where you can both show that the church is not true, but
            that you can show the unique church doctrines are not good. This is a terrible doctrine and one that
            continues today, where the First Presidency can cancel a sealing of one marriage so that the member can
            marry into another sealing. In that case, the children are then taken from one spouse and given to another
            in the eyes of the God as the church sees it.
            <br><br>
            This is a terrible, horrible, abhorrent practice that makes absolutely no sense from a loving God. Not only
            does a wife have to marry Joseph Smith in addition to her legal husband that she might actually love, but
            their kids are then given to and sealed to Joseph Smith in the eyes of God - not to their actual father. It
            is horrific and no amount of “it’ll work out in the end” can change that.
            <br><br>
            Not only is Joseph Smith violating D&C 132 by marrying and having sex with women who are not virgins, the
            theology behind it is also absolutely terrible. This is another example where you can see how Joseph Smith
            making it up as he went along really comes back to haunt him, as he puts these rules in the voice of God to
            convince his ‘beloved Emma’ as he is currently violating almost every one of them in real life.
            <br><br>
            The question you have to ask yourself is this: Is Joseph Smith in violation of D&C 132 and a fallen prophet,
            or was he using the voice of God to convince Emma of polygamy knowing that he was secretly breaking all of
            the rules he was creating to convince Emma that the practice is virtuous and right?
        </p>

        <h3>The Concept of Adultery in D&C 132</h3>

        <p>
            Clearly the idea of adultery is being redefined through polygamy, but the following verses are kind of
            interesting all things considered:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            43 And if her husband be with another woman, and he was under a avow, he hath broken his vow and hath
            committed adultery.

            44 And if she hath not committed adultery, but is innocent and hath not broken her vow, and she knoweth it,
            and I reveal it unto you, my servant Joseph, then shall you have power, by the power of my Holy Priesthood,
            to take her and give her unto him that hath not committed adultery but hath been faithful; for he shall be
            made ruler over many.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Joseph Smith made a vow to Emma Smith at their wedding to be faithful, and he broke that with Fanny Alger.
            Years later Joseph Smith would break that vow with many women behind Emma’s back, and there is simply no way
            around this basic fact.
            <br><br>
            And that makes verse 44 all the more egregious. The voice of God is saying that if a man breaks his vow but
            the woman has not, she can go to Joseph and be given to another. So effectively in Emma’s case she would go
            to Joseph, say that Joseph broke his vow, and then be asked to be given to another. But then D&C 132 also
            says she will be destroyed for doing so.
            <br><br>
            Do you see how problematic this revelation is? This is also where Joseph F. Smith’s very troubling statement
            originates from. Here is Joseph F. Smith from Doctrines and Salvation:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “When the wife is faithful and desires to obey the divine law and the husband is rebellious, or unwilling to
            obey the will of the Lord, if she maintains her integrity to the best of her ability, she will be given to
            another husband in eternity and will receive all the blessings of the celestial kingdom.” (Joseph Fielding
            Smith, Answers to Gospel Questions, Vol. 3, Pg. 23, 24. Pub. 195)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This doctrine by Joseph F. Smith is directly reflecting D&C 132 and causes a lot of stress for people who
            are mixed faith marriages, because in the church’s teachings if a man leaves the church, the wife will then
            be “given to another husband in eternity.” As we will see in future overviews, the doctrines and practices
            that come from polygamy will influence almost every aspect of the church, and this is a perfect example of
            that.
        </p>

        <h3>Contradictions with the Book of Mormon and Earlier Revelations</h3>

        <p>
            Beyond all of the problems with the text of D&C 132 itself, this revelation directly contradicts both the
            Book of Mormon and earlier revelations from Joseph Smith. I want to make this crystal clear – it is
            irreconcilable.
            <br><br>
            First, here is the very plain and straightforward text from the Book of Mormon in Jacob 2:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            23 But the word of God burdens me because of your grosser crimes. For behold, thus saith the Lord: This
            people begin to wax in iniquity; they understand not the scriptures, <strong>for they seek to excuse
                themselves in
                committing whoredoms, because of the things which were written concerning David, and Solomon his
                son.</strong>
            <br><br>
            24 Behold, <strong>David and Solomon truly had many wives and concubines, which thing was abominable before
                me</strong>,
            saith the Lord.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Now compare to D&C 132:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            1 Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you my servant Joseph, that inasmuch as you have inquired of my hand to
            know and understand <strong>wherein I, the Lord, justified my servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as also
                Moses,
                David and Solomon, my servants, as touching the principle and doctrine of their having many wives and
                concubines—</strong>
            <br><br>
            38 David also received many wives and concubines, and also Solomon and Moses my servants, as also many
            others of my servants, from the beginning of creation until this time; and <strong>in nothing did they
                sin</strong> save in
            those things which they received not of me.
            <br><br>
            39 <strong>David’s wives and concubines were given unto him of me</strong>, by the hand of Nathan, my
            servant, and others of
            the prophets who had the keys of this power; and in none of these things did he sin against me save in the
            case of Uriah and his wife; and, therefore he hath fallen from his exaltation, and received his portion; and
            he shall not inherit them out of the world, for I gave them unto another, saith the Lord.’
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            You cannot reconcile this – in the Book of Mormon God says they are committing whoredoms and that the
            practice is abominable, and then in D&C 132 he says “in nothing did they sin” and that those wives and
            concubines where “given unto him of me… and in none of these things did he sin against me…”
            <br><br>
            In other words, in the Book of Mormon God is directly calling David’s wives abominable, and in the D&C God
            is saying that not only was it completely legitimate, but that God was the one who gave them to him.
        </p>

        <h3>Holding Marriage Contracts Valid and Fulfilled</h3>

        <p>
            In the 1835 Doctrine and Covenants, we discussed above the section that rejects polygamy, but there’s
            another line that is completely destroyed by D&C 132. From the original 1835 Doctrine and Covenants:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “All legal contracts of marriage made before a person is baptized into this church, should be held sacred
            and fulfilled.” (<a href="" target="_blank">The Joseph Smith Papers. <em>Doctrine and Covenants, 1835,
                    Section 101</em></a>)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Compare that to D&C 132:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            7 “All covenants, contracts, bonds, obligations, oaths, vows, performances, connections, associations, or
            expectations, that are not made and entered into and sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise… are of no
            efficacy, virtue, or force in and after the resurrection from the dead; for all contracts that are not made
            unto this end have an end when men are dead.”
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            To be clear, the 1835 Doctrine and Covenants states that the church will hold all legal contracts of
            marriage as sacred and fulfilled, but D&C 132 says those same legal contracts “end when men are dead.”
            <br><br>
            While apologists could contend that marriages have the “til death do us part” clause, this is simply not how
            any Christian religion believes their families will be after death. This is an area where Joseph Smith is
            creating a problem to sell you the solution, but it absolutely contradicts the spirit of holding “legal
            contracts of marriage… sacred and fulfilled.”
        </p>

        <h3>Earlier Revelations are Unaware of Any 1831 Revelation on Polygamy/Plural Marriage</h3>

        <p>
            Now I want to quickly note two of Joseph Smith’s earlier revelations that contradict D&C 132:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            D&C 42:22 (Written in 1831) 22 Thou shalt love thy wife with all thy heart, and shalt cleave unto her and
            none else.
            <br><br>
            D&C 49:16 (Written in 1831) 16 Wherefore, it is lawful that he should have one wife, and they twain shall be
            one flesh, and all this that the earth might answer the end of its creation
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Both of these revelations, written in 1831 when we are told by the church that Joseph Smith had polygamy
            revealed to him, are explicit in having one wife and that one “shalt cleave unto her and none else.”
            <br><br>
            I don’t know how much clearer this gets. Just like the First Vision and priesthood restorations, we can see
            the earlier teachings that are supposedly directly from God are 100% contradicting Joseph Smith’s later
            evolution in theology. If the revelation on polygamy was given to Joseph Smith in 1831, why does he seem
            completely unaware of it until the 1840s?
            <br><br>
            Furthermore, these revelations were first edited and compiled in 1835, which is both after Joseph Smith
            supposedly was given the revelation on polygamy and when he had already had an affair with Fanny Alger. If
            Joseph Smith had truly received a revelation from God, then why did he not make any changes to these
            revelations in 1835? We know that Joseph Smith was willing to alter revelations as we illustrated in the
            priesthood restoration overview, which is a clear indicator that Joseph Smith never changed these
            revelations because he did not develop the doctrine or revelation of polygamy before 1835.
            <br><br>
            This is what happens when you are willing to change scriptures to fit your needs at a given time, and we
            highlighted this in our Book of Mormon overviews as Joseph Smith changed Isaiah to retrofit a prophecy about
            the Charles Anthon visit or, in the case of D&C 132, claimed that Abraham was commanded to enter into
            polygamy by God when it simply did not happen.
            <br><br>
            D&C 132 states that “mine house is a house of order, saith the Lord God, and not a house of confusion,” and
            yet this same God, via Joseph Smith, has contradictions throughout the scriptures, revelations, and
            doctrines of the church. As I stated above, this requires us to answer this question: Is God this
            inconsistent and contradictory within the scriptures, or is Joseph Smith writing in the name of God to
            convince others that he is a prophet of God? I believe in these overviews we have made it crystal clear that
            it’s the latter, and D&C 132 only reinforces that belief.
        </p>

        <h3>The Law of Sarah</h3>

        <p>
            We are going to cover many of the problems with D&C 132 in our third polygamy overview as we look at some of
            the ways Joseph Smith proposed to other women, but I want to cover how ridiculous the “Law of Sarah” is very
            quickly. From the church’s essay:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “The revelation on marriage required that a wife give her consent before her husband could enter into plural
            marriage.4 Nevertheless, toward the end of the revelation, the Lord said that if the first wife “receive not
            this law”—the command to practice plural marriage—the husband would be “exempt from the law of Sarah,”
            presumably the requirement that the husband gain the consent of the first wife before marrying additional
            women. After Emma opposed plural marriage (and before, since Joseph never asked early on and just married
            women behind her back), Joseph was placed in an agonizing dilemma, forced to choose between the will of God
            and the will of his beloved Emma. He may have thought Emma’s rejection of plural marriage exempted him from
            the law of Sarah. Her decision to “receive not this law” permitted him to marry additional wives without her
            consent”
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This really sums of the Law of Sarah nicely. In D&C 132, verse 61 makes clear that the first wife must give
            consent before her husband can marry and have sex with other women, but in penultimate verse Joseph Smith
            realizes that he has to give himself an out, so he creates the idea of a “Law of Sarah” which basically says
            that if Emma doesn’t agree to this revelation, Joseph Smith can just do it anyway. From D&C 132:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            61 And again, as pertaining to the law of the priesthood—if any man espouse a virgin, and desire to espouse
            another, and the first give her consent, and if he espouse the second, and they are virgins, and have vowed
            to no other man, then is he justified; he cannot commit adultery for they are given unto him; for he cannot
            commit adultery with that that belongeth unto him and to no one else.
            <br><br>
            65 Therefore, it shall be lawful in me, if she receive not this law, for him to receive all things
            whatsoever I, the Lord his God, will give unto him, because she did not believe and administer unto him
            according to my word; and she then becomes the transgressor; and he is exempt from the law of Sarah, who
            administered unto Abraham according to the law when I commanded Abraham to take Hagar to wife.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            I’m not sure how much more obvious it can get that this revelation is being written by a man who is trying
            to justify his practice of polygamy to his wife. Beyond the threats of destruction, the scolding for not
            obeying God, and the incorrect Bible references (God did not command Abraham to take Hagar, Sarah did),
            Joseph Smith here is going to tell her that her voice does not matter in any possible way.
            <br><br>
            Verse 65 is basically saying to his “beloved Emma” that ‘I’m asking you to give me permission to marry and
            have sex with a bunch of younger women, because if you don’t I’m just going to do it behind your back anyway
            and it will then be you who is at fault.’ It is awful, terrible, and such a perfect example of how women are
            viewed in the church. They are secondary to men in every measureable way, and in polygamy this was
            unquestionably so.
            <br><br>
            The church’s essay constantly tries to frame Joseph Smith as the victim, which is even more insane when you
            read this overview along with the next two. When they write “Joseph was placed in an agonizing dilemma,
            forced to choose between the will of God and the will of his beloved Emma,” it is absolutely shameless.
            Joseph Smith is not the victim here, and the church’s entire essay is framed to make the reader think that
            Joseph Smith was trying to be the perfect husband while also obeying God’s commandments. The problem is that
            once you dig into the history behind D&C 132, you realize quickly that it is not God’s commandment but
            Joseph Smith using the voice of God to command others.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Conclusion of the First Part of the Polygamy Overview
        </h2>

        <p>
            We still have a lot to cover with polygamy, so I hope you’ll continue with me to part two. In the second
            overview, I will cover some of the proposals that Joseph Smith made to show the pressures and promises that
            he was using to convince young women to marry him, and the agony he put families through by asking men for
            their wives or daughters.
            <br><br>
            While I realize my tone in this overview is more negative than the previous overviews, I hope you can
            understand why. Polygamy is not normal, it is not righteous, and the history is clear that it was an abuse
            of authority by Joseph Smith.
            <br><br>
            I cannot even imagine the pain and suffering that Emma Smith was put through, knowing that her husband
            continued to be unfaithful years after the Fanny Alger affair, and I wonder if she ever knew how many of her
            friends were married to her husband behind her back. If a member saw this happening with any other political
            or religious leader, they would recoil with disgust. This is simply not the way that a loving God would
            command their prophet to act, and, preemptively answering the apologetic response that I can’t know what God
            would want, I’ll be clear that this is not a version of God that is deserving of my love or worship.
            <br><br>
            Polygamy is disgraceful and the next overview is only going to illustrate that in more detail, so if you
            felt uncomfortable in this section it’s only going to get worse. I’m sorry for those reading this that do
            not want to have that knot in their stomach reading about church history, but, as my family has said over
            the years when dealing with a bad situation that is unfortunately real, “it is what it is.”
            <br><br>
            I also want to finish this first overview by stating something that will be important to remember as you
            read the next two overviews on polygamy: Joseph Smith was the one who inquired about polygamy. From the very
            first verse of D&C 132:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you my servant Joseph, that inasmuch as you have inquired of my hand to
            know and understand wherein I, the Lord, justified my servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as also Moses,
            David and Solomon, my servants, as touching the principle and doctrine of their having many wives and
            concubines (D&C 132:1)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Joseph Smith was the one who initiated this subject with God - not the other way around as it is often
            taught. As you read the accounts of how Joseph Smith is telling these young women that God commanded them to
            marry Joseph, please remember that Joseph himself admits in D&C 132 that polygamy was his idea. This might
            seem like a small thing, but I believe it is an important detail, especially given the quote at the
            beginning of this overview highlighting how other self-proclaimed prophets used their authority to initiate
            polyagmous/sexual relations with their young followers.
            <br><br>
            In the next two overviews, I am going to look at some of the records we have of how Joseph Smith proposed to
            other women, how the church tried to cover up polygamy with “carefully worded denials,” and we will get into
            the story of the angel with a drawn sword who was concerned about Joseph Smith having sex with other women,
            but never returned to correct how women, blacks, and Native Americans were being treated and labeled by the
            church.
