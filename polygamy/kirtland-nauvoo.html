        <h1>A Comprehensive Analysis of the LDS Essay on Plural Marriage in Kirtland and Nauvoo</h1>

        <p>
            This annotated essay examines the official LDS Church release titled "Plural Marriage in Kirtland and
            Nauvoo." The essay was published by the Church to clarify misconceptions surrounding Joseph Smith's
            introduction of both polygamy (marrying multiple wives) and polyandry (marrying women who were already
            married to other men). In this version, all text in <span class="essay-text">blue</span> represents the
            original, unedited content from the
            Church, while my comments are added in black. The original essay can be accessed on the official LDS website
            (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics-essays/plural-marriage-in-kirtland-and-nauvoo?lang=eng"
                target="_blank"><em>Plural Marriage in Kirtland and Nauvoo</em></a>).
            <br><br>
            The following annotated essay is adapted from a source that regularly updates this material. You may view
            the original, continually updated version by <a

            <br><br>
            Before delving into the essay, it’s important to highlight a key point: While the Church often emphasizes
            that prophets are "imperfect men" who may have engaged in actions now considered sinful, Church leaders,
            including Prophet Benson in 1981, have taught that "The prophet will never lead the Church astray," as
            emphasized in the <a
                href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/liahona/1981/06/fourteen-fundamentals-in-following-the-prophet?lang=eng"
                target="_blank"> <em>Fourteen Fundamentals in Following the Prophet</em></a>. This perspective is
            crucial to consider,
            given the practices Joseph Smith introduced that are now renounced and difficult to reconcile. The
            legitimacy of the Church is closely tied to Joseph Smith’s actions, and this essay addresses a chapter of
            his life that is complex and, for many, indefensible. The reasoning provided for these practices is often
            contradictory, as explored below.
            <br><br>
            This annotated essay is detailed and extensive, aiming to present a thorough understanding of Joseph Smith's
            relationship with polygamy and how it contrasts with the Church's current narrative. Many members of the
            Church may find much of this information new, and our additional notes provide further insights. Prominent
            LDS historian Richard Bushman remarked: "I think that for the Church to remain strong it has to reconstruct
            its narrative. The dominant narrative is not true; it can’t be sustained. The Church has to absorb all this
            new information or it will be on very shaky grounds and that’s what it is trying to do and it will be a
            strain for a lot of people, older people especially. But I think it has to change." (<a

                Latter-day Saints believe that monogamy—the marriage of one man and one woman—is the Lord’s standing law

            (This footnote refers to D&C 132:34-39, which states that God commanded Abraham to sleep with Hagar, his
            wife’s handmaiden. But according to the Bible it was Abraham’s wife Sara, <strong>not God</strong>, who told
            Abraham to take
            her handmaiden so that Abraham would be able to father children.( Genesis 16:1-3 (KJV)). <strong>Nowhere in
                the Bible
                are men commanded by God to take plural wives, with the one possible exception of Hosea, which was not
                anything like what Joseph implemented</strong>. The Book of Mormon author Jacob strongly condemned
            polygamy, and
            specifically David’s and Solomon’s practice, which Jacob characterized as an “abomination” before God.
            (Jacob 2:24). But Jacob did allow a loophole: “For if I will, saith the Lord of Hosts, raise up seed to me,
            I will command my people, otherwise they shall hearken unto these things.”(Jacob 2:30). The Bible is very
            clear on some aspects of plural marriage, so we must be very careful about using the Bible as a
            justification for polygamy because it requires that we pick and choose only the specific verses that suit
            our needs. For example, Leviticus 18 forbids marrying a mother and her daughter, and marrying sisters which
            is important because as we will see, Joseph Smith and other early leaders did both of these things.
            (Campbell & Campbell, 1978, Utah Historical Quarterly, V 46, N. 1 ; Daynes, 2001, More Wives Than One, p
            70))

            <span class="essay-text">
                ,Joseph Smith married multiple wives and introduced the practice to close associates. This principle was
                among the most challenging aspects of the Restoration—for Joseph personally and for other Church
                members.
                Plural marriage tested faith and provoked controversy and opposition. Few Latter-day Saints initially
                welcomed the restoration of a biblical practice entirely foreign to their sensibilities. But many later
                testified of powerful spiritual experiences that helped them overcome their hesitation and gave them
                courage
                to accept this practice.
            </span>
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="essay-text">
                Although the Lord commanded the adoption—and later the cessation—of plural marriage in the latter days,
                He did not give exact instructions on how to obey the commandment.
            </span>
            (​While the essay wants to set the table that the polygamy revelation was unclear, it does so against the
            revelations they use to justify it. There is a very specific polygamy revelation that states, “Behold, mine
            house is a house of order, saith the Lord God, and <strong>not a house of confusion.</strong>” ( D&C 132:8).
            That same
            section begins the revelation about polygamy by saying: “Therefore, prepare thy heart to receive and obey
            the instructions which I am about to give unto you,” which is then followed by a very clear and specific set
            of instructions. <br><br>
            And why would God not give instructions for such an important, difficult and controversial commandment,
            considering that the D&C is full of very specific instructions about much more insignificant things like
            mission callings, the buying and selling of property, exact amounts that specific people should invest in
            the Nauvoo House, etc. But this statement appears to be dishonest because God actually did give exact
            instructions to Joseph. <strong>The problem is that Joseph didn’t follow them.</strong> The actual words in
            D&C 132 are very
            clear on how polygamy was to be practiced. First, D&C 132 states that <strong>Joseph was to marry only
                virgins</strong>
            (verses 61-62), but this essay later admits that many of Joseph’s wives were <strong>simultaneously married
                to other
                men and definitely not virgins</strong>. It also specifies that he should obtain the consent of his
            first wife (verse
            61), but quickly introduces the loophole (verse 65) that if the first wife does not accept polygamy, Joseph
            could take virgin brides without her consent. It is very important to note that Joseph had many wives long
            before he even revealed the idea of polygamy to Emma, so he ignored the very clear process of this part of
            the revelation as well. D&C 132 also explicitly declares that if she stands in the way, <strong>Emma will be
                “destroyed.”</strong> And if that’s not enough, according to church apologists, in addition to these
            very specific
            instructions, God revealed to Joseph the very words for the plural marriage ceremony. (Brian Hales, Bio of
            Sarah Ann Whitney, www.josephsmithspolygamy.com, citing an unpublished revelation.) Which leaves the
            question of why the essay would declare that God did not give specific instructions on polygamy when, in
            fact, the instructions were very clear but not followed.)

            <span class="essay-text">
                Significant social and cultural changes often include misunderstandings and difficulties. Church leaders
                and
                members experienced these challenges as they heeded the command to practice plural marriage and again
                later
                as they worked to discontinue it after Church President Wilford Woodruff issued an inspired statement
                known
                as the Manifesto in 1890, which led to the end of plural marriage in the Church.
            </span>
            (This is another point of the essay that is not entirely true. While the manifesto was a claim to the
            outside world that the church had ended polygamy, church leaders actually continued to perform secret plural
            marriages until the Second Manifesto ended polygamy “for real” in 1904... although there were still
            occasional authorized polygamous marriages up until 1920)

                Many details about the early practice of plural marriage are unknown. Plural
                marriage was introduced among the early Saints incrementally, and <strong>participants were asked to
                    keep
                    their

                after

            years after he began the practice. He also kept this info secret from his initial wife Emma, and many early
            church members including Oliver Cowdery heard nothing of polygamy early on and assumed Joseph Smith was
            having an affair with Fanny Alger (Oliver Cowdery, Letter to Warren A. Cowdery, January 21, 1838))

        <h2>The Beginnings of Plural Marriage in the Church</h2>

        <p>
            <span class="essay-text">
                The revelation on plural marriage was not written down until 1843, but its early verses suggest that
                part of it emerged from Joseph Smith’s study of the Old Testament in 1831.
            </span>
            (This date is inferred because Joseph was already being accused of polygamy in the early thirties, due to
            his"affair" with his 16-year old live-in maid Fanny Alger, that we are told became his wife around 1833
            although no marriage records exist. There were also accusations of other incidents besides Fanny. For
            instance, the famous mob attack in which Joseph was tarred and feathered was led by one of the Johnson
            brothers, fueled by his accusation that Joseph had been indecently involved with their little sister. It is
            significant that they brought a doctor along to castrate Joseph. In these times, that is the only behavior
            that warranted punishment by castration)

            <span class="essay-text">
                People who knew Joseph well later stated he received the revelation about that time.<a class="note-ref"

                become
                white, delightsome and just.</strong>” This is probably not mentioned specifically in the essay because
            of its racist
            overtones and contradiction to the instructions in D&C 132. This statement also contradicts the church’s
            other polygamy essay (Plural Marriage and Families in Early Utah), which says, “the practice of plural
            marriage - <strong>the marriage of one man to two or more women - was instituted among members of The Church

            The shift in doctrine between the Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants raises a perplexing
            question: why would God deliver such conflicting messages about polygamy? Joseph Smith revealed Jacob
            2:24—where polygamy is condemned as "abominable"—before he began practicing it himself. Later, however,
            after he had already taken multiple wives, he introduced Doctrine and Covenants 132, which presents polygamy
            not only as acceptable but as divinely sanctioned under specific circumstances. The timing here is crucial:
            a strong condemnation is given first, and then, later, an endorsement appears. This sequence invites us to
            question whether these revelations represent evolving divine insight or if other factors were at play. Why
            would God introduce such dramatically different messages, potentially creating confusion for believers? The
            seeming contradiction suggests either an unexplained change in divine will or a response to shifting
            personal and social influences on Joseph Smith.

            When God commands a difficult task, He sometimes sends additional messengers to encourage His people to
            obey.
            Consistent with this pattern, Joseph told associates that an angel appeared to him three times between 1834
            and 1842 and commanded him to proceed with plural marriage when he hesitated to move forward. During the
            third and final appearance, the angel came with a drawn sword, threatening Joseph with destruction unless he
            went forward and obeyed the commandment fully.<a class="note-ref"

            This raises an essential question: Is this truly how God operates, or is it a means to manipulate someone
            into acting against their own morals and conscience? If God's intention was to establish this doctrine, why
            didn’t He simply send the angel directly to the women involved to inspire their understanding? Instead,
            Joseph Smith relied on a private, unverifiable story with an unusual command that contradicts fundamental
            Biblical teachings.
            <br><br>
            If the angel first appeared in the early 1830s, prompting Joseph to marry Fanny Alger, why would this angel
            need to return repeatedly to threaten him? Strangely, Joseph continued to use the story of an angelic
            warning long after he had already married over twenty wives. To secure some of these marriages—often
            involving very young women—Joseph promised their parents that they and their families would be exalted in
            the Celestial Kingdom as a reward for "sacrificing" their daughters. If these initial proposals were
            unsuccessful, he reportedly invoked the angel story to pressure compliance. Why would God enforce a
            situation where women’s free agency was compromised by family-wide promises of exaltation, compounded by the
            threat of Joseph’s destruction if they refused a polygamous marriage?
            <br><br>
            It's worth stepping back to consider the context of divine intervention as described in the early
            restoration, according to Joseph Smith. God sent angels with momentous messages on a few key occasions:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Moroni’s delivery of the Gold Plates
            </li>
            <li>
                The restoration of the Aaronic and Melchizedek priesthoods
            </li>
            <li>
                Elijah’s bestowal of the sealing keys
            </li>
            <li>
                And, if Joseph Smith's account is to be believed, a mandate for him to marry multiple wives
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The church narrative suggests that polygamy was such a high priority in God’s plan that Joseph's life
            depended on it. Yet, later, with a single letter—Wilford Woodruff’s "Official Declaration 1" in the Doctrine
            and Covenants—this central revelation was officially disavowed. Why would God insist so vehemently on a
            principle that could later be so easily set aside?
            <br><br>
            A final troubling aspect of the angel story lies in what it implies about God’s will. We are asked to accept
            that God sent an angel to command Joseph, who then used this story to pressure potential brides. Yet, D&C
            132 tells us that the revelation itself only came because Joseph asked why certain Biblical figures had
            multiple wives. The scripture reads:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you my servant Joseph, that inasmuch as you have inquired of my hand to
            know and understand wherein I, the Lord, justified my servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as also Moses,
            David and Solomon, my servants, as touching the principle and doctrine of their having many wives and
            concubines—(<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132?lang=eng"
                target="_blank"> <em>D&C 132: 1</em></a>)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            The church’s official essay, approved by the First Presidency, essentially asks believers to accept this
            story as both credible and morally redemptive. But does it make sense? Joseph asked God why others were
            allowed multiple wives, and God’s response was not only an endorsement (despite Biblical prohibitions) but
            also included sending an angel to compel Joseph to expand this idea further. Viewed logically, this story
            conflicts with foundational Biblical principles and strains belief.

                Fragmentary evidence suggests that Joseph Smith acted on the angel’s first command by marrying a plural

                , and
                nothing is known about the conversations between Joseph and Emma regarding Alger.
            </span>
            (Except that Emma, who had previously loved their live-in babysitter and housekeeper like a daughter,
            immediately kicked her out of the house upon discovering her relationship with Joseph. This is the
            relationship that Oliver Cowdery described as a “dirty, nasty, filthy affair.” (Bushman, Joseph Smith: Rough
            Stone Rolling, p. 323), an accusation that resulted in Oliver’s excommunication. Fanny was the first of many
            teenage girls that Joseph first brought into his home as a servant or foster daughter and then later married
            without Emma’s knowledge or approval. Another example is the Partridge sisters, who Joseph and Emma took
            into their home as foster daughters after the death of their father. Joseph secretly married them and then,
            as will be revealed later in this essay, was forced to marry them again in a mock wedding with Emma’s
            knowledge).

            <span class="essay-text">
                After the marriage with
                Alger ended in separation, Joseph seems to have set the subject of plural marriage aside until after the
                Church moved to Nauvoo, Illinois.
            </span>
            (A “separation” which consisted of Emma throwing Fanny out of the house in the middle of the night after she
            caught her and Joseph in the act by peeking through a gap between the boards of the barn (Compton, 1997, In
            Sacred Loneliness, p. 34.) In Sacred Loneliness is also footnote #29 in this essay, which means the LDS
            church considers it a reputable source).
        </p>

        <p>
            So we must ask, what kind of “marriage” did Joseph have with Fanny Alger? It was not a legal marriage,
            because he was already legally married to Emma. According to the laws of Ohio and the United States this
            relationship was considered adultery. What do the 12th Article of Faith say about obeying the law? Neither
            can we call this a celestial marriage, because the Fanny affair happened around 1833-34 and the sealing
            power would not be restored until 1836 with the visit of Elijah to the Kirtland temple. Joseph’s own reason,
            as stated to Levi Hancock, who claims to have performed the marriage (although there is much doubt about
            whether such a ceremony was actually performed, since it was only reported decades later), was simply that
            Joseph was in love with Fanny.
            <br><br>
            Sarah Ann Whitney was a 17-year old teenage bride who married Joseph with her parents’ approval in trade for
            Joseph’s promise of their eternal glory. On August 18th, several weeks after the marriage, Joseph wrote a
            letter to his new bride and her parents while he was hiding from the law at a home on the outskirts of
            Nauvoo: “...my feelings are so strong for you since what has passed lately between us...it seems, as if I
            could not live long in this way; and if you three would come and see me...it would afford me great

                The same revelation that taught of plural marriage was part of a larger revelation given to Joseph
                Smith—that marriage could last beyond death and that eternal marriage was essential to inheriting the
                fulness that God desires for His children. As early as 1840, Joseph Smith privately taught Apostle

            The revelation on eternal marriage was first written down in 1843 after Emma demanded to see a revelation
            before she would agree to let Joseph marry plural wives, even though he already had 20 or so wives that he
            was keeping secret from her. The new potential wives were the Partridge sisters, who were the Smith’s foster
            daughters. Joseph produced the document and Hyrum delivered it to Emma. She burned it. Fortunately Hyrum had
            another copy which is now preserved as Section 132 of the Doctrine and Covenants. If you read the entire
            section, including the verses that are never included in Sunday school discussions, it is clear that the
            “new and everlasting covenant” refers specifically to plural marriage, not to monogamous temple marriage, as
            we are taught today. Brigham Young later clearly differentiated between “celestial marriage” (i.e. polygamy)
            and monogamy. (Journal of Discourses, vol. 14, p. 43 (May 8, 1870) and openly derided monogamy and
            identified it as an evil practice: “... this monogamic system which now prevails throughout all Christendom,
            and which has been so fruitful a source of prostitution and whoredom throughout all the Christian monogamic
            cities of the Old and New World, until rottenness and decay are at the root of their institutions both
            national and religious.” (Brigham Young, Journal of Discourses, v. 11, p. 128))

            Actually, early prophets made it clear that men who did not participate in polygamy could not participate in
            exaltation in the highest degree of glory, and would not even be allowed to keep the one wife to which they
            were sealed:

            will perhaps be saved in the Celestial Kingdom; but when he gets there he will not find himself in
            possession of any wife at all.... and he will remain single forever and ever.” (Prophet Brigham Young,

            “I understand the law of celestial marriage to mean that every man in this Church, who has the ability to

            This is another area of the essay that is clearly dishonest when they refer to "carefully worded denials.”
            The footnote from the essay explains these denials thus: “In the denials, “polygamy” was understood to mean
            the marriage of one man to more than one woman but without Church sanction.” Effectively, they are
            differentiating between “polygamy” and “plural marriage” as verbal semantics that Joseph used to lie to both
            the public and most members of the church about his secret marriages. Just to make it clear, the “members
            and leaders” mentioned here refers mostly to Joseph himself. In other words he lied publicly, both in
            printed articles and in public speeches about his plural marriages by using a politician’s trick of having a
            different definition in his head from the definition that he knows you have in your head. When Bill Clinton
            said, “I did not have sexual relations with that woman,” he was excluding oral sex from his personal
            definition of sexual relations. This is a ploy that later came to be known among the church leadership as
            “lying for the lord” and there are many examples of it. Remember, this essay was approved by the First
            Presidency and Apostles. It flatly states that Joseph committed a crime and then lied about it. In order to
            convince us that the so-called “carefully worded denials” aren't damaging to the reasons why polygamy is
            from God, the essay redefines a very important word and buries it in an endnote, which they know most people
            will not read. Put another way, the essay contends that if Joseph Smith chooses to call his relationships
            with all of these polygamous wives “celestial marriage” it’s gives him room to deceptively deny the charges
            of “polygamy.”
            <br><br>
            In one example of Joseph’s public “carefully worded denials” he said, "What a thing it is for a man to be
            accused of committing adultery, and having seven wives, when I can only find one" - (Joseph Smith - LDS
            History of the Church 6:411). Joseph had over 20 wives at the time he made this statement.
            <br><br>
            From the Gospel Principles Manual lesson 31, Honesty:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            Complete honesty is necessary for our salvation. President Brigham Young said, “If we accept salvation on
            the terms it is offered to us, we have got to be honest in every thought, in our reflections, in our
            meditations, in our private circles, in our deals, in our declarations, and in every act of our lives”
            (Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Brigham Young [1997], 293).”
            <br><br>
            Satan would have us believe it is all right to lie. He says, “Yea, lie a little; … there is no harm in this”
            (2 Nephi 28:8). Satan encourages us to justify our lies to ourselves. <strong>Honest people will recognize
                Satan’s
                temptations and will speak the whole truth, even if it seems to be to their disadvantage</strong>.
            <br><br>
            There are many other forms of lying. When we speak untruths, we are guilty of lying. We can also
            intentionally deceive others by a gesture or a look, by silence, or by telling only part of the truth.
            <strong>Whenever we lead people in any way to believe something that is not true, we are not being
                honest</strong>.

            “carnal intercourse” with Joseph Smith on multiple occasions (Emily Dow Partridge Young, Deposition, Temple
            Lot Transcript, Part 3). Apologists have tried to explain this as a false testimony that she was forced to
            give at the command of Brigham Young and other priesthood leaders who were unquestionably having sex with
            multiple women at the time. Again we are left with a moral dilemma: was Emily telling the truth about her
            sexual encounters with the prophet Joseph, or was the current prophet forcing her to lie about Joseph’s
            sexual relationship with her? One of these must be the correct answer but either implicates a prophet.
            Neither option is good, but one of them must be true.

                Most of those sealed to Joseph Smith were between 20 and 40 years of age at the
                time of their sealing to him. The oldest, Fanny Young, was 56 years old. The youngest was Helen Mar
                Kimball,
                daughter of Joseph’s close friends Heber C. and Vilate Murray Kimball, who was sealed to Joseph

            37-year old Joseph Smith, even though apologists contend there was nothing wrong with it and it was actually
            common for a 37 year old to marry a 14 year old (and while it was certainly more common for women to get
            married at 14 than it is now, it wasn't at all common for that marriage to be with someone 23 years older))

            <span class="essay-text">
                . Marriage at such an age, inappropriate by today’s standards,
                was legal in
                that era, and some women married in their mid-teens.<a class="note-ref"
                    href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics-essays/plural-marriage-in-kirtland-and-nauvoo?lang=eng#note26"

        <p>
            Notice the emphasis is made here on the legality of marrying a 14-year old, as if the fact that it’s legal
            is all we should be concerned about. If the authors are really concerned about legality this might be a good
            time to remind them that this marriage was already undeniably illegal because of its polygamous nature, so
            the legality argument goes right out the window. The essay also fails to mention Joseph’s other illegal
            14-year old wife, Nancy Maria Winchester (Compton, p. 606).
            <br><br>
            I will also challenge the favorite apologetic excuse for Joseph’s marriage to Helen and other teenagers that
            it was common for older men to marry 14-year olds at the time. This is absolutely not true. Yes, it was
            legal (if the only marriage), but it was rare and it was no less scandalous in Victorian America than it is
            today. The average marriage age for women was 20 and for men 24, almost always marrying someone near their
            own age. It must also be pointed out that 19th century girls typically had their first period three years
            later than girls do today. In terms of sexual maturity, marrying a 19th century 14-year old was the
            equivalent of marrying a 21st century 11-year old, so these were very possibly prepubescent girls (Boaz,
            1999, Essentials of biological anthropology).
            <br><br>
            To put it in more modern, church-relevant terms, Joseph's wives break down like this:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Mia Maids: 2
            </li>
            <li>
                Laurels: 5
            </li>
            <li>
                YSA girls: 7
            </li>
            <li>
                Relief Society sisters: 20+ (half of them already married to other men)
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            These comments sound very harsh, but there are facts that speak for themselves. Given the details
            surrounding the revelation, it is important to note the inconsistencies, the timeline issues, how Joseph
            Smith broke D&C 132, and how he lied to everyone about it including his wife. These are not "anti-Mormon"
            statements, but verifiable facts through church approved sources.
            <br><br>
            We must also consider the circumstances around Helen’s betrothal to Joseph. First Joseph commanded Helen’s
            father, Heber C. Kimball to turn his own wife, Vilate, over to Joseph as a plural wife. After a great deal
            of anguish, Heber finally agreed. When the Kimballs showed up to deliver Vilate to Joseph, and when Joseph
            saw how distraught and broken-hearted the Kimballs were, he showed mercy and told them the request had
            really only been a test of Heber’s loyalty, with Vilate serving as a prop. Heber would be allowed to keep
            his wife after all, but was later allowed to offer his 14-year old daughter in her stead, and as was common
            in these proposals, Joseph would guarantee a place in the Celestial Kingdom for the entire Kimball family.
            How could the family turn down such a high pressure offer? Once Joseph knew that Heber was more loyal to him
            than to his own family he knew he could ask anything of him.

            This defense of plural marriage is a reference to a poem that Helen wrote much later in life, but in which
            she tells a much more complicated story. Here is the potion to which they are referring. Helen actually
            seems to be longing for freedom from here relationship with Joseph:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            I thought through this life my time will be my own
            <br>
            The step I now am taking’s for eternity alone,
            <br>
            No one need be the wiser, through time I shall be free,
            <br>
            And as the past hath been the future still will be.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            If you read the entire poem you will see that she actually complains about how she felt deceived that she
            had been told that the marriage was for “eternity alone” but afterward found that she was removed from
            society, became the target of “slanderous tongues” and realized that she had made a “generous sacrifice”
            without weighing the “bitter price.”
            <br><br>
            She also wrote that her father had traded her to the Prophet to get into Joseph’s inner circle. She said:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “My father had but one Ewe Lamb, but willingly laid her upon the alter: how cruel this seemed to the mother
            whose heartstrings were already stretched until they were ready to snap asunder, for he had taken Sarah Noon
            to wife & she thought she had made sufficient sacrifice, but the Lord required more… I will pass over the
            temptations which I had during the twenty four hours after my father introduced to me this principle & asked
            me if I would be sealed to Joseph, who came next morning & with my parents I heard him teach & explain the
            principle of Celestial marriage -- after which he said to me, “<strong>If you will take this step, it will
                ensure
                your eternal salvation and exaltation & that of your father’s household & all of your kindred.</strong>”
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            How could Joseph Smith claim that a single step by one individual could ensure not only her own exaltation
            but also that of her entire family and all her kindred? Such a sweeping promise seems to go far beyond
            church doctrines, which emphasize personal accountability and individual faith.
            Continuing with Helen’s recollection:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            This promise was so great that I willingly gave myself to purchase so glorious a reward. None but God & his
            angels could see my mother’s bleeding heart — when Joseph asked her if she was willing, she replied “If
            Helen is willing I have nothing more to say.” She had witnessed the sufferings of others, who were older &
            who better understood the step they were taking, & to see her child, who had scarcely seen her fifteenth
            summer, following in the same thorny path, in her mind she saw the misery which was as sure to come as the
            sun was to rise and set; but it was all hidden from me” (Helen Mar Whitney, Autobiography, March 30, 1881).
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This is not as tidy as you are led to believe, and these decisions with heartbreaking for these women to
            make. This agonized memoir was written almost 40 years later, after Helen had supposedly become, according
            to this essay, an “articulate defender” of polygamy.
            <br><br>
            Although this essay tries to dissuade us from any notion that these marriages were sexual in nature, Helen,
            in another document stressed in her own words the essentially sexual nature of these polygamous marriages:
            “It was revealed to the latter that there were thousands of spirits, yet unborn, who were anxiously waiting
            for the privilege of coming down to take tabernacles of flesh... which makes this plural wife system an
            actual necessity… The principle was established by the Prophet Joseph Smith, and all who have entered into
            it in righteousness, have done so for the purpose of raising a righteous seed. (Helen Mar Whitney, Why We
            Practice Plural Marriage, pp. 7-8 (Juvenile Instructor 1884 - spelling and grammar as in original)).Consider
            that Helen asks us to accept that the sole purpose of plural marriage is for procreation, why should we
            assume that she herself is the exception?
            <br><br>
            After Joseph’s death Helen remarried, moved to Utah and had 11 children with her new husband, but was never
            permitted to be sealed to him because she she already belonged to Joseph - What kind of God would deny
            eternal life and sealing to the father of 11 children based on Joseph Smith marrying her as he did? That is
            a question that has no answer.

        <p>
            This is, again, a misleading statement. This essay wants you to assume that Joseph only married into all of
            these polygamous relationships to build a dynasty for himself after his death. While it is true that some of
            the women left no record, others certainly did! For example, Joseph’s polyandrous wife Patty Bartlett
            Sessions wrote in her journal: “I was sealed to Joseph Smith by Willard Richards Mar 9, 1842, in Newel K.
            Whitney's chamber, Nauvoo, for time and all eternity ... (Noall, Intimate Disciple, Portrait of Willard
            Richards, p. 611).
            <br><br>
            Other polyandrous wives indicated that their marriage was more than just dynastic in nature. After Joseph’s
            death <strong>
                some of these women were claimed by Brigham Young and had children with him.</strong> Louisa bore 5
            children to
            Brigham.<strong> When Joseph married Zina Jacobs (after several rejected proposals and finally a warning of
                retribution by the sword-wielding angel) she was already pregnant by her husband Henry, who was a
                faithful
                member of the church and a president of the Seventy, and who remained deeply in love with his wife for
                the
                rest of his life despite being sent away on many missions, during one of which Joseph married his wife.
                Later Brigham sent Henry on a mission and impregnated Zina while he was away (Compton, pp. 84, 88, 90–9)
            </strong>.
            Women like Louisa and Zina are the best evidence that these polyandrous marriages were NOT merely for
            eternity. <strong>
                Brigham said he practiced polygamy exactly as taught to him by Joseph Smith</strong>. These women
            remained
            sealed to Joseph after his death but were married for time only (Designation here, again, for sex) to
            Brigham Young, all while they remained married to their original husbands.
            <br><br>
            But what is the reason of designating an “eternity alone” marriage anyway, apart from a rhetorical tactic
            for church apologists to avoid the implication of sex? First, it defies the proclaimed purpose of polygamy,
            which is to “raise up righteous seed.” Second, even if these marriages were purely dynastic in nature (but
            they weren’t and this essay admits this despite its attempts to tiptoe around it), was it really more
            honorable for Joseph to take a man’s wife for all of eternity, rather than for just a few years, just to
            grow Joseph’s own dynasty while robbing the dynasty of another man who would otherwise have shared with his
            wife for eternity? It seems not only wrong on a moral level, but it has no connection to any Biblical
            teachings before Joseph Smith.
            <br><br>
            Regardless of whether or not Joseph had sex with Helen, the church today recognizes that he did have sex
            with other young wives, because they themselves testified that he did, and some even signed affidavits to
            that effect to disprove the claims of the Reorganized church that Joseph was not a polygamist. But why
            should this be such a surprise? There is no argument that Brigham Young and later prophets’ marriages, many
            of them to teenagers, were not sexual in nature, including some women and girls who had also been married to
            Joseph. Brigham even had his own expanded version of polyandry; if he wanted a woman he would simply take
            her away from her husband by authority of his superior priesthood standing. He even gave a General
            Conference talk about it where he said, “<strong>If a woman can find a man holding the keys of the
                priesthood with
                higher power and authority than her husband (i.e. himself and those around him), and he is disposed to
                take
                her, he can do so, otherwise she has got to remain where she is.</strong> (George D. Watts, Conference
            Reports, Oct.
            8, 1861)
            <br><br>
            In addition, it is well understood that other polygamist men in Nauvoo, such as Joseph Smith’s personal

            had not been living the principle correctly Joseph would have called them to repentance and removed them
            from their callings, and probably from the church entirely, as he did with the men who practiced “spiritual
            wifery” without his express permission as referenced above. Instead, Joseph kept these men close to him and
            in his confidence and they retained their high priesthood callings. He gave them his blessing and encouraged
            them to take even more wives.

            It is misleading to suggest that Joseph Smith heroically "rescued" women from unworthy husbands. Consider
            Sarah Pratt as an example: Joseph began making advances toward her—which she refused—after sending her
            husband, Orson Pratt, on a mission to Europe. Orson was a devoted church member, trusted enough to serve a
            mission and later become the longest-serving Apostle. Did Sarah need Joseph’s intervention because her
            husband was an inadequate priesthood holder? Or consider Marinda Johnson Hyde, whom Joseph married after
            sending her husband, Orson Hyde, also an Apostle, to Jerusalem to consecrate Palestine for Israel’s
            gathering. Was Orson Hyde unworthy?
            <br><br>
            Reflect on how this information is often framed. Notice the frequent use of phrases like “may be,” “may
            have,” “another possibility,” “several possible explanations,” and “he may have believed.” Why can’t an
            essay sanctioned by the Prophet and Apostles offer clear answers to fundamental questions? Why should Joseph
            be excused as a “product of his time” when he violated his own revelations, written only years after
            polygamy became public? This essay suggests Joseph’s actions were God’s will, yet Church leaders and
            apologists repeatedly fall back on the “you can’t expect perfection” rationale. The essay seems to imply
            that questioning is either unfaithful or unreasonably demanding, which are conflicting propositions.
            <br><br>
            If plural marriage was simply to link families, why were so many of Joseph’s wives young girls or other
            men’s spouses? The Law of Adoption allowed men to be sealed as sons to other men; why didn’t Joseph seal
            these men directly to him? Or, why not seal these young women as celestial daughters, allowing them to find
            suitable husbands later? Why deny them the chance for companionship with peers? Helen Kimball, for example,
            stated she couldn’t associate with friends because she was now “married.” And if there was no sexual aspect
            to these sealings, why not limit them to older women or widows, as we were once told?
            <br><br>
            This undermines the “dynastic/kinship bond” rationale. If the sealings were purely eternal, Joseph could
            have told Emma honestly, “I love the Kimballs and want an eternal bond with them.” There would have been no
            need for secrecy, no deceit, no “burn this letter” instructions. If this practice were as noble as
            presented, there would be no cause for secrecy or damage to families. Simply sealing families would not have
            broken laws, nor would it have caused such distress to families and young girls.

            This might be a good time to point out that Joseph Smith was not only breaking the laws of the land and
            lying to Emma and everyone outside of his secret circle, he was also disobeying every revelation he had
            received on the subject of marriage. We have already seen how he was disobeying the requirement to marry
            only virgins, as commanded in D&C 132 . At least a dozen of his wives were already married to other men. But
            worse, he was doing all of this while the Doctrine and Covenants still contained the original Section 101,
            which has been deleted from today’s version of the D&C. The former Section 101 was replaced in the 1876
            version of the D&C by the Section 132 we have today. Why the change? Because the former Section was in
            complete contradiction to Joseph’s behavior at the time. It clearly denounced polygamy and contained the
            unambiguous commandment that all members of the LDS Church practice ONLY monogamy. The relevant verse says:
            “Inasmuch as this church of Christ has been reproached with the crime of fornication, and polygamy: we
            declare that we believe, that one man should have one wife; and one woman, but one husband, except in the
            case of death, when either is at liberty to marry again ( D&C 101:4 - 1835 ed.). Notice that this section
            was added to the D&C solely because Joseph Smith had been accused of polygamy. Joseph’s behavior constituted
            adultery under both the laws of the land and the laws of God, according to canonized latter-day scripture.
            Would God have given Joseph Smith a revelation that was not true as we now know Section 101 to have been
            when supposedly given?

            persuaded Emma to allow him to take plural wives, and she reluctantly granted permission for him to marry
            the Partridge sisters. However, rather than being transparent with his "beloved Emma," Joseph arranged a
            second, mock wedding with Emily and Eliza. (Compton, p. 409). Shortly afterward, Emma reconsidered her

                his

            (What is not stressed in current LDS history is that it was the polygamous contingent of the church that
            moved west, and those who were still unaware of the depths of polygamy. Those who knew about polygamy and
            did not want to participate stayed behind and formed the RLDS. In their view it was the polygamists who left
            the church as it does not fit with the teachings of God and not them. These saints numbered in the thousands
            and included Emma and her children, Joseph’s mother, his only living brother, the Three Witnesses and all of
            the living Eight Witnesses).

        <p>
            Emma’s brief acceptance of polygamy was based, in part, on an understanding that she would be financially
            secure, regardless of what happened to Joseph. Joseph’s personal secretary, William Clayton, recorded that,
            only hours after Emma initially rejected the polygamy revelation,
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “Joseph told me to deed all the unencumbered lots to Emma and the children. He appears much troubled about
            Emma.”

            Three days later, Clayton recorded another entry:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “Made Deed for 1/2 Steam Boat Maid of Iowa from Joseph to Emma. Also a Deed to Emma for over 60 city lots”.

        <p>
            William Law later recalled a conversation with Emma, probably held in the fall of 1843, where she confided
            in him:

        <blockquote>
            “Joe and I have settled our troubles on the basis of equal rights.” (The Law Interview, The Daily Tribune:
            Salt Lake City, July 31, 1887)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Following these assurances and agreements, Emma finally consented for Joseph to marry the Partridge sisters,

            her own temple endowment.

            it is a non-truth. Once again the entire premise of this revelation is undercut, which again begs the

                Some Saints also saw plural marriage as a redemptive process of sacrifice and spiritual refinement.
                According to Helen Mar Kimball, Joseph Smith stated that “the practice of this principle would be the
                hardest trial the Saints would ever have to test their faith.” Though it was one of the “severest”

            before then asking for and marrying his 14 year old daughter. In exchange, Joseph promised the entire
            Kimball family exaltation, which goes against doctrine and once again treats women like a commodity to

            Why was Heber so happy? His wife had finally given him permission to start bringing other women into their
            marriage, just like Joseph. What Vilate didn’t know at the time was that Heber was already secretly married
            to his first plural wife, Sarah Noon, in violation of D&C 132’s admonition that the first wife must give
            approval before taking other wives. Heber went on to marry 43 women. He said, “For a man of God to be
            confined to one woman is small business... I do not know what we should do if we had only one wife apiece”
            (Heber C. Kimball, Deseret News, April 22, 1857). One of the things he is remembered for was repeatedly
            chastising missionaries for marrying the pretty girls and sending the “ugly” ones back to Utah for him and
            the other General Authorities to pick through. Here’s one of several of his well documented comments along
            those lines: “The brother missionaries have been in the habit of picking out the prettiest women for
            themselves before they get here, and bringing on the ugly ones for us; hereafter you have to bring them all
            here before taking any of them, and let us all have a fair shake."(Apostle Heber C. Kimball, The Lion of the
            Lord, New York, 1969, pp.129-30) . Kimball also famously declared before a gathering of the saints,
            “<strong>I think
                no more of taking another wife than I do of buying a cow.</strong>” (Ann-Eliza Snow, Wife No. 19,
            Chapter 17) When
            women are treated as commodities, it is difficult to feel that there is any sincerity among the men
            participating in polygamy that they are spiritually troubled by it.

            then secretly marrying them. Lucy arrived in Nauvoo with her father, mother, and 9 siblings. When her mother
            died of malaria Joseph immediately sent Lucy’s father on a mission, promising to care for his family. Six of
            the children were sent to other homes but Joseph said, “the four Eldest shall come to my house and [be]
            received and treated as my own children” Lucy was 15 years old at the time. Shortly after her father was on

            the salvation of her and her entire family. He told her she had one day to consider before he revoked the
            eternal privileges. After a great deal of agony, Lucy accepted and was married secretly to Joseph. Remember,
            this was a child entirely dependent on this man for her family's eternal exaltation as well as temporal
            living. She said ““Emma Smith was not present and she did not consent to the marriage; she did not know
            anything about it at all.” Of the relationship, Lucy said, "<strong>I afterwards married Joseph as a plural
                wife and lived and cohabitated with him as such</strong>… It was not a love matter, so to speak, in our
            affairs, - at least on my part it was not, <strong>but simply the giving up of myself as a

                The challenge of introducing a principle as controversial as plural marriage is almost impossible to
                overstate. A spiritual witness of its truthfulness allowed Joseph Smith and other Latter-day Saints to
                accept this principle. Difficult as it was, the introduction of plural marriage in Nauvoo did indeed

            So, the essay’s ultimate conclusion is that, regardless of what went on in Kirtland and Nauvoo, God will
            “sort it all out in the end anyway.” If that’s the case, why did Joseph Smith have to go through with it in
            the first place? Why secretly marry women and young girls without Emma’s knowledge? Why marry women who
            already had devoted, morally upright husbands? Why destroy the <em>Nauvoo Expositor</em> printing press,
            which,
            according to this essay,<strong> was telling the truth about him</strong>, ultimately leading to his arrest
            for treason and
            subsequent death? Why would God send a sword-wielding angel to threaten Joseph if He intended to “sort
            things out” in the end?
            <br><br>
            This raises the question of why church leaders cannot provide satisfactory answers beyond two conflicting
            options. Are we supposed to “give Brother Joseph a break” (Neil L. Andersen, General Conference, October
            2015) because he, along with other leaders, were products of their time? Or should we accept that God left
            them to figure things out on their own, even though Joseph recorded the revelation ten years after beginning
            these relationships? Should we believe, as this essay suggests, that Joseph was fulfilling God’s will—forced
            to do so by a sword-wielding angel—even though it meant disobeying D&C 132, breaking the law, and causing
            sorrow to Emma and others?
            <br><br>
            The essay leaves more questions than it answers. For example, why should we accept its claim that polygamy
            was essential, doctrinal, and divinely mandated, despite a more recent prophet declaring, “I condemn it
            [polygamy], yes, as a practice, because I think it is not doctrinal” (Gordon B. Hinckley, Larry King Live,
            September 8, 1998)?
            <br><br>
            The essay exposes difficult truths, acknowledging that Joseph Smith married dozens of women, including
            teenage girls as young as 14, and women already married to other men. While it suggests he may not have had
            intimate relationships with all, it concedes he did with some, often behind Emma’s back. For those who live
            by the strict moral expectations of the LDS church, these admissions are unsettling. More troubling still is
            the essay’s attempt to excuse or even condone such behavior, urging members to accept it as “righteous and
            godly.”
            <br><br>
            The essay’s creators ask us to disregard cherished values about families, suggesting that it’s acceptable to
            look the other way for certain priesthood leaders. They imply that if you struggle with polygamy, it’s due
            to a lack of prayer or faith, leaving members feeling inadequate for questioning such actions. This dynamic
            borders on gaslighting and encourages an unhealthy mindset—one that discourages individuals from trusting
            their moral instincts, instead relying on others to dictate right and wrong.
            <br><br>
            It’s no surprise this essay has led some members to leave. It insists that God compelled Joseph to practice
            polygamy under threat, despite Joseph initiating the practice. It suggests God allowed a prophet to
            disregard D&C 101 and replace it with a revelation that was, in turn, not followed.
            <br><br>
            We must also question what kind of God would sanction a man taking the wives of other faithful members or
            allow him to marry teenage girls he was entrusted to care for as daughters.
            <br><br>
            Finally, the notion that answers can be found through personal revelation ignores the fact that polygamous
            sects today also claim revelation from God. If these sects receive revelation supporting polygamy, how can
            we trust our own revelations are any more valid and not simply confirming our biases? (<a

                    of other religions talking about their spiritual revelations is here, and will start with the

            <br><br>
            Thank you for reading this annotated essay to the end. I recognize it is long and contains challenging
            information, much of which is unfamiliar to many LDS members. I hope it encourages you to seek a
            comprehensive view, consulting both LDS and non-LDS sources, and to read D&C 132 in full with the knowledge
            this essay provides. It’s difficult to reconcile a belief in God allowing behavior that subjects young women
            to the choice between marrying a self-proclaimed prophet or losing their family’s chance at exaltation. It
            is wrong, immoral, and does not lend credibility to Joseph Smith as a true prophet of God.
