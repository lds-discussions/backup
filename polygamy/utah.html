        <h1>A Comprehensive Analysis of the LDS Essay on Plural Marriage</h1>

        <p>
            The following is an annotated version of the official LDS essay titled <em>Plural Marriage in The Church of
                Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</em>. This essay was released by the Church to clarify common public
            misconceptions about
            polygamy in the Utah period, especially following Joseph Smith’s death. In the annotated essay below, all
            text in black is from the unaltered official Church essay, while my comments appear in blue. You can find
            the original essay on the LDS website [<a
                href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics-essays/plural-marriage-in-the-church-of-jesus-christ-of-latter-day-saints?lang=eng"
                target="_blank">here</a>].
            <br><br>
            One point I’d like to address before delving into the essay is the Church’s tendency to refer to prophets as
            "imperfect men" when discussing actions now regarded as sinful. However, their own teachings urge us to
            "Follow the Prophet" regardless of personal views on morality or acceptability. In 1981, Prophet Benson
            outlined that, "The prophet will never
            lead the Church astray." (<a
                href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/liahona/1981/06/fourteen-fundamentals-in-following-the-prophet?lang=eng"
                target="_blank"> <em>Fourteen Fundamentals in Following the Prophet</em></a>) This is crucial as we move
            forward, given that the LDS Church practiced beliefs now
            disavowed, which are challenging to reconcile. The legitimacy of the Church rests heavily on Joseph Smith’s
            revelations both condemning and commanding polygamy, and this essay explores an area where Joseph Smith and
            later prophets introduced a practice that seems indefensible, with contradictory justifications, as will be
            discussed below.
            <br><br>
            This annotated essay is not as extensive as our Kirtland and Nauvoo version, which thoroughly examines the
            misuse of this practice by Joseph Smith. We encourage readers to review that Kirtland/Nauvoo annotated essay
            before proceeding, as this one builds on the insights presented there. Much of the content in this essay
            will be new to many members, and our additional notes are likely unfamiliar to almost all. A comprehensive
            understanding of Joseph Smith’s polygamy is essential to grasp how it diverges from the current Church
            narrative. As prominent LDS historian Richard Bushman stated:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            "I think that for the Church to remain strong it has to reconstruct its narrative. The dominant narrative is
            not true; it can’t be sustained. The Church has to absorb all this new information or it will be on very
            shaky grounds and that’s what it is trying to do and it will be a strain for a lot of people, older people
            especially. But I think it has to change." (<a

            (This first sentence of the essay is already being dishonest. <strong>Men are still allowed to be sealed to
                more
                than one woman</strong>, and the current prophet of the church is currently sealed to two women for
            eternity. The
            first sentence is also a knock on gay marriage, in not allowing the possibility of same sex marriages while
            defending the practice of polygamy.)

                . In biblical times, the Lord commanded some to practice plural marriage—the marriage of one man and

                than one woman.<a target="_blank" class="note-ref"

            (This footnote refers to D&C 132:34-39, which states that God commanded Abraham to sleep with Hagar, his
            wife’s handmaiden. But according to the Bible it was Abraham’s wife Sara, not God, who told Abraham to take
            her handmaiden so that Abraham would be able to father children.( Genesis 16:1-3 (KJV)). Nowhere in the
            Bible
            are men commanded by God to take plural wives. The Book of Mormon author Jacob strongly condemned polygamy,
            and specifically David’s and Solomon’s practice, which Jacob characterized as an “abomination” before God.
            (Jacob 2:24). But Jacob did allow a loophole: “For if I will, saith the Lord of Hosts, raise up seed to me,
            I will command my people, otherwise they shall hearken unto these things.”(Jacob 2:30). The Bible is very
            clear on some aspects of plural marriage, so we must be very careful about using the Bible as a
            justification for polygamy because it requires that we pick and choose only the specific verses that suit
            our needs. For example, Leviticus 18 forbids marrying a mother and her daughter, and marrying sisters which
            is important because as we will see, Joseph Smith and other early leaders did both of these things.
            (Campbell & Campbell, 1978, Utah Historical Quarterly, V 46, N. 1 ; Daynes, 2001, More Wives Than One, p
            70))


            <span class="essay-text">
                By revelation, the Lord commanded Joseph
                Smith to
                institute the practice of plural marriage among Church members in the early 1840s. For more than half a
                century, plural marriage was practiced by some Latter-day Saints under the direction of the Church
                President.<a target="_blank" class="note-ref"

            (Joseph Smith did not note this revelation until a decade after he was already practicing polygamy, which
            began with Fanny Alger and led to the excommunication of Oliver Cowdery as he called it an affair.)

                Latter-day Saints do not understand all of God’s purposes in instituting, through His prophets, the
                practice
                of plural marriage. The Book of Mormon identifies one reason for God to command it: to increase the
                number
                of children born in the gospel covenant in order to “raise up seed unto [the Lord].”<a target="_blank"

            (Joseph Smith, of course, has no known kids from polygamy but was married to at least 33 wives and had sex
            with at least 1/3 of them. D&C 132 also states that polygamy should only be entered into with virgins, yet
            Joseph Smith married 11 women that were already married to other men, some of whom he sent on missions
            before marrying their wives while gone. The point here is that even with this one small quote from the Book
            of Mormon to allow this, Joseph Smith broke every one of the rules of polygamy which makes us question how
            credible the commandment could have been.)

        <p>
            <span class="essay-text">
                Plural marriage did result in the birth of large numbers of children within faithful Latter-day Saint
                homes.
            </span>
            (This is, of course, what happens when men take on many wives and have sexual relations with them. However,
            women in polygamous marriages actually had fewer children than those in traditional marriage. In fact, "The
            research also revealed that while polygamous men had dozens of children, the practice of having multiple
            wives (and thus sexual partners) had the opposite effect on women: For every wife added to the fold, the
            average number of children per wife dropped by one. “The more wives a woman’s husband has, the fewer
            children she is going to have personally,” study author Michael Wade, a biologist at Indiana University
            Bloomington, told LiveScience. “That’s interesting, and evolutionary biologists would say then that polygamy
            is good for males and maybe not so good for females.”" (Pappas, Live Science Contributor | February 28,
            2011))

                It also shaped 19th-century Mormon society in many ways: marriage became available to virtually all who
                desired it; per-capita inequality of wealth was diminished as economically disadvantaged women married
                into
                more financially stable households; and ethnic intermarriages were increased, which helped to unite a
                diverse immigrant population. Plural marriage also helped create and strengthen a sense of cohesion and
                group identification among Latter-day Saints. Church members came to see themselves as a “peculiar
                people,”
                covenant-bound to carry out the commands of God despite outside opposition.<a target="_blank"

            This paints a really happy and clean picture of polygamy, but of course as the Kirtland/Nauvoo essay and
            this one show, it is anything but. The footnote here is to an unpublished article, so it is impossible to
            know exactly what they are trying to say, but saying 'ethnic intermarriages' implies that the church
            welcomed those who had black or other skin colors into mixed-ethnicity marriage. Brigham Young on
            interracial marriages: If the white man who belongs to the chosen seed mixes his blood with the seed of
            Cain, <strong>the penalty, under the law of God, is death on the spot. This will always be so</strong>.
            (Journal of
            Discourses, v. 10, p. 110). The composition of Mormons between 1850-1890 was over 99% white. (Perlich 2002)
            What they almost certainly mean is that the intermarriages were with those from Europe who arrived without
            knowing the church was fully into polygamy, and then were married into the house of a male member of the
            church. This paragraph also rallies Mormons around the idea that it built community because everyone around
            them thought polygamy was an abomination, which is true that those ideas can solidify loyalty and belief to
            a cause, but that can be said of the FLDS and their practice of polygamy today.
            <br><br>
            With regards to diminishing inequality of wealth, according to the source cited by the essay, this effect
            only applies when per-capita wealth is measured within families, not per-capita of the population at large.
            Since polygamous families are larger than monogamous ones, the per-capita wealth within a family is more
            evenly distributed. In Utah as a whole, however, the distribution of wealth was very unequal. (Daynes 2001,
            p. 133).
            <br><br>
            On average, church leaders were 2-3 times more wealthy than the average member. (Daynes, p 130--131) and the
            <strong>top ten members were eleven times more wealthy</strong>. (p 128) This is in large part why leaders
            took more wives
            than the average member - they could both afford to care for the polygamous wives, and also could attract
            them with their positions in the church.
            <br><br>
            The author of the study further issues this clarification which goes against the essay that cites him: “To
            redistribute the wealth in the the territory when Utah was among the poorest areas <strong>gave no one
                opulence</strong>; for
            the most part, <strong>it simply mitigated the worst poverty and shared the burden of struggling for a
                living in a
                semiarid land.</strong>” (p. 135)

            (I hate copying from what we just said above, but this paragraph once again implies that the Bible commands
            polygamy which it never does. Joseph Smith "inquired" about polygamy, which makes one wonder why after the
            Bible constantly calls it an abomination, he would then go and inquire of the Lord why he doesn't get more
            women but those in the Bible did. Since this paragraph repeats the earlier claim, we will do so here as
            well: This footnote refers to D&C 132:34-39, which states that God commanded Abraham to sleep with Hagar,
            his wife’s handmaiden. But according to the Bible it was Abraham’s wife Sara, not God, who told Abraham to
            take her handmaiden so that Abraham would be able to father children.( Genesis 16:1-3 (KJV)). Nowhere in the
            Bible are men commanded by God to take plural wives. The Book of Mormon author Jacob strongly condemned
            polygamy, and specifically David’s and Solomon’s practice, which Jacob characterized as an “abomination”
            before God. (Jacob 2:24). But Jacob did allow a loophole: “For if I will, saith the Lord of Hosts, raise up
            seed to me, I will command my people, otherwise they shall hearken unto these things.”(Jacob 2:30). The
            Bible is very clear on some aspects of plural marriage, so we must be very careful about using the Bible as
            a justification for polygamy because it requires that we pick and choose only the specific verses that suit
            our needs. For example, Leviticus 18 forbids marrying a mother and her daughter, and marrying sisters which
            is important because as we will see, Joseph Smith and other early leaders did both of these things.

                The same revelation that taught of plural marriage was embedded within a revelation about eternal
                marriage—the teaching that marriage could last beyond death. Monogamous and plural marriages performed
                by
                priesthood power could seal loved ones to each other for eternity, on condition of righteousness.<a

            (What is interesting is that sealings did not begin until 1841 while Joseph Smith was already practicing
            polygamy years earlier, which begs the question of why the revelation was not recorded until 1843 with
            different doctrines that were clearly implemented at different times. Again, the most obvious conclusion is
            that Joseph Smith needed to write down revelation to assert credibility to practices that he could not
            longer keep secret from his members and the public.)

                The revelation on marriage stated general principles; it did not explain how to implement plural
                marriage in
                all its particulars. In Nauvoo, Joseph Smith married additional wives and authorized other Latter-day
                Saints
                to practice plural marriage. The practice was introduced carefully and incrementally, and participants
                vowed
                to keep their participation confidential, anticipating a time when husbands and wives could acknowledge
                one
                another publicly.

        </p>

        <p>
            We’ll also draw from our Kirtland and Nauvoo essay, as the suggestion that God’s instructions on polygamy
            were unclear is, at best, misleading. While the essay tries to imply that the revelation on polygamy lacked
            clarity, it does so in contrast to the very revelations cited to justify it. The specific revelation on
            polygamy in Doctrine and Covenants 132 clearly states, “Behold, mine house is a house of order, saith the
            Lord God, and not a house of confusion.” (D&C 132:8). This same section begins with the words: “Therefore,
            prepare thy heart to receive and obey the instructions which I am about to give unto you,” followed by
            explicit instructions.
            <br><br>
            If God provided such specific direction on less significant matters—like mission callings, property
            transactions, and investment details for the Nauvoo House—it would seem logical that He would be equally
            clear on a major, complex commandment like polygamy. The statement in the essay, however, appears
            misleading, as God did indeed give Joseph specific instructions. The issue lies in <strong>Joseph’s failure
                to
                follow them</strong>. D&C 132 is quite explicit about how polygamy should be practiced: it specifies
            that Joseph was
            <strong>to marry only virgins</strong> (verses 61-62), yet the essay later concedes that <strong>many of his
                wives were already
                married and not virgins</strong>. It also states that Joseph should obtain the consent of his first wife
            (verse 61),
            though a loophole in verse 65 allows him to proceed without her consent if she disagrees. Notably, Joseph
            took several wives long before he informed Emma of polygamy, thus disregarding this clear instruction.
            <br><br>
            Furthermore, D&C 132 warns that if Emma opposes, she will be “<strong>destroyed.</strong>” Church apologists
            add that God
            even revealed the specific language for the plural marriage ceremony (Brian Hales, Bio of Sarah Ann Whitney,
            www.josephsmithspolygamy.com, citing an unpublished revelation). This raises the question of why the essay
            suggests that God did not provide specifics when, in reality, the instructions were clear—they simply
            weren’t followed.

        </span>

        <p>
            <span class="essay-text">
                Between 1852 and 1890, Latter-day Saints openly practiced plural marriage. Most plural families lived in
                Utah. Women and men who lived within plural marriage attested to challenges and difficulties but also to
                the love and joy they found within their families. They believed it was a commandment of God at that
                time and that obedience would bring great blessings to them and their posterity. Church leaders taught
                that participants in plural marriages should seek to develop a generous spirit of unselfishness and the
                pure love of Christ for everyone involved.
            </span>
            (Many women noted hardship and difficulties with polygamy, and LDS member Todd Compton's book In Sacred
            Lonliness is a geat resource to see just hot difficult it was to see their husbands take on additional wives
            or to be entered into a polygamous marriage only because of the promise of exaltation by Joseph Smith or
            Brigham Young. While many of them did talk publicly about the blessings of polygamy, it is worth noting
            that, again, they were told their exaltation depended on living as a faithful wife in a polygamous marriage.
            This is the same way that women in LDS breakoff sects talk today, but we do not celebrate those feelings as
            being from God.)

            <span class="essay-text">
                Although some leaders had large polygamous families, two-thirds of polygamist men had only two wives at
                a time. Church leaders recognized that plural marriages could be particularly difficult for women.
                Divorce was therefore available to women who were unhappy in their marriages; remarriage was also
                readily available. Women sometimes married at young ages in the first decade of Utah settlement, which
                was typical of women living in frontier areas at the time. At its peak in 1857, perhaps one half of all
                Utah Latter-day Saints experienced plural marriage as a husband, wife, or child. The percentage of those
                involved in plural marriage steadily declined over the next three decades.

            <span class="essay-text">
                During the years that plural marriage was publicly taught, not all Latter-day
                Saints were expected to live the principle, though all were expected to accept it as a revelation from
                God.
            </span>
            (Brigham Young once said: It is the word of the Lord, and I wish to say to you, and all the world, that if
            you desire with all your hearts to obtain the blessings which Abraham obtained, you will be polygamists at
            least in your faith, or you will come short of enjoying the salvation and the glory which Abraham has
            obtained. This is as true as that God lives... <strong>The only men who become Gods, even the Sons of God,
                are those who enter into polygamy</strong>. Others attain unto a glory and may even be permitted to come
            into the presence of the Father and the Son; but they cannot reign as kings in glory, because they had
            blessings offered unto them, and they refused to accept them. (Journal of Discourses 11:268-269). Apologists
            argue that Brigham Young is not saying that you have to enter into polygamy to become Gods, but just to have
            faith in it as a commandment. I would argue that the quote is pretty clear that you have to at least have
            faith in it to enter the Celestial Kingdom, but to enter the higher level of the Celestial Kingdom and
            become Gods, you have to enter into polygamy.)

            <span class="essay-text">
                Indeed, this system of marriage could not have been universal due to the ratio of men to women. Women
                were
                free to choose their spouses, whether to enter into a polygamous or a monogamous union, or whether to
                marry
                at all. Some men entered plural marriage because they were asked to do so by Church leaders, while
                others
                initiated the process themselves; all were required to obtain the approval of Church leaders before
                entering
                a plural marriage.
            </span>
        </p>

        <p>
            This last paragraph is misleading, as evidenced by the Kirtland/Nauvoo essay. Many women were asked to enter
            into polygamy with the promise of exaltation for themselves and their entire families. The pressure this
            placed on young women was immense, especially as higher-ranking leaders often married many young women,
            limiting marriage prospects for younger men.
            <br><br>
            After polygamy was introduced, it was taught as a commandment from God, essential for salvation. Although
            women were free to choose their spouses, the church positioned polygamy as a key to exaltation, compelling
            many women to relinquish their hopes of a loving, monogamous marriage in exchange for promised rewards in
            the afterlife. Mormon researcher Kathryn Daynes highlighted that “without that doctrinal foundation, few, if
            any, would have entered into plural marriages” (Daynes 2001, p. 116).
            <br><br>
            The pressure on women is illustrated by 14-year-old Helen Mar Kimball's experience when Joseph Smith took
            her as a polygamous wife:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            "[Joseph] said to me, “If you will take this step, it will ensure your eternal salvation and exaltation &
            that of your father’s household & all of your kindred. This promise was so great that I willingly gave
            myself to purchase so glorious a reward. None but God & his angels could see my mother’s bleeding heart—when
            Joseph asked her if she was willing, she replied “If Helen is willing I have nothing more to say.” She had
            witnessed the sufferings of others, who were older & who better understood the step they were taking, & to
            see her child, who had scarcely seen her fifteenth summer, following in the same thorny path, in her mind
            she saw the misery which was as sure to come as the sun was to rise and set; but it was all hidden from me."
            (Letter from Helen Mar Whitney to her children, March 30, 1881)
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            "I would never have been sealed to Joseph had I known it was anything more than ceremony. I was young, and
            they deceived me, by saying the salvation of our whole family depended on it.” (Helen Mar Whitney journal:
            Helen Mar autobiography: “Woman's Exponent,” 1880)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Helen also noted that Joseph Smith used similar promises to marry 17-year-old Sarah Ann Whitney, observing
            that:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “No earthly inducement could ne held forth to the women who entered this order. It was to be a
            life-sacrifice for the sake of an everlasting glory and exaltation” (Compton, In Sacred Loneliness, 1997 pp.
            349, 499).
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Such pressures on women persisted beyond Joseph Smith's time. Later leaders married multiple women, often
            preventing them from experiencing a marriage based on mutual love. This revealed significant issues within
            Joseph Smith’s "revelation."
            <br><br>
            A stark example of the abuse within this "new and everlasting covenant" involved Zina Huntington. Although
            she chose to marry Henry Jacobs, a devoted church member, Joseph Smith persisted in seeking her as a
            polygamous wife:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “[Joseph] sent word to me by my brother, saying, ‘Tell Zina, I put it off and put it off till an angel with
            a drawn sword stood by me and told me if I did not establish that principle upon the earth I would lose my
            position and my life’” Joseph Smith then declared that “the Lord had made it known to him she was to be his
            celestial wife.” (Compton, In Sacred Loneliness)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Smith ultimately convinced Zina to become his celestial wife, despite claims that their union was "for
            eternity only"—a term suggesting a non-physical relationship. After Smith’s death, however, Brigham Young
            married Zina, and she later bore him a child, raising questions about Young’s role and intentions.
            <br><br>
            Henry Jacobs, upon learning of Zina’s marriage and child with Young, lamented:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “I am unhappy... there is no peace for poor me, my pleasure is you, my comfort has vanished.... O Zina, can
            I ever, will I ever get you again, answer the question please.”
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Henry never regained his relationship with Zina, as she was sealed for eternity to another man. This
            situation raises profound ethical and theological questions. If D&C 132 was truly divinely inspired, why did
            Smith and Young appear to violate it without consequence? This history suggests that Joseph Smith's system
            often treated women as property, with later leaders further abusing this dynamic.
            <br><br>
            Finally, Brigham Young’s words starkly illustrate the extent of abuse within the doctrine:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            "The second way in which a wife can be separated from her husband while he continues to be faithful to his
            God and his priesthood I have not revealed except to a few persons in this church, and a few have received
            it from Joseph the Prophet as well as myself. <strong>If a woman can find a man holding the keys of the
                priesthood
                with higher power and authority than her husband, and he is disposed to take her, he can do so,
                otherwise
                she has got to remain where she is.</strong>" (Conference Reports, October 8, 1861 (reported by George
            D. Watt))
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            If D&C 132 were genuinely a divine revelation, designed to establish eternal principles of marriage and
            exaltation, one would expect its key advocates—Joseph Smith and Brigham Young—to embody its principles with
            integrity and respect for all involved. Yet the historical reality shows a much different picture,
            particularly in cases like that of Henry Jacobs, who was left devastated after losing his beloved wife,
            Zina, to this practice. If this revelation was truly meant to promote spiritual growth and harmony, why
            would it permit a situation that caused such personal agony, robbing a husband of his wife and a chance at a
            loving family life? The reality of Henry’s pain casts a harsh light on the revelation’s human impact. A
            doctrine intended for divine purposes would logically aim to strengthen, not shatter, bonds of love and
            family. Such inconsistencies—where men are allowed to sidestep ethical obligations and leave others broken
            in their wake—suggest that D&C 132 may not be divine but rather a system that justified painful separations
            and ultimately served the ambitions of a select few rather than any true spiritual or moral end.

                Beginning in 1862, the U.S. government passed laws against the practice of plural marriage. After the
                U.S. Supreme Court found the anti-polygamy laws to be constitutional in 1879, federal officials began
                prosecuting polygamous husbands and wives during the 1880s. Believing these laws to be unjust,
                Latter-day Saints engaged in civil disobedience by continuing to practice plural marriage and by
                attempting to avoid arrest by moving to the homes of friends or family or by hiding under assumed names.
                When convicted, they paid fines and submitted to jail time.
            </p>

            <p>
                One of the anti-polygamy laws permitted the U.S. government to seize Church property. Federal officers
                soon threatened to take Latter-day Saint temples. The work of salvation for both the living and the dead
                was now in jeopardy. In September 1890, Church President Wilford Woodruff felt inspired to issue the
                Manifesto. “Inasmuch as laws have been enacted by Congress forbidding plural marriages,” President
                Woodruff explained, “I hereby declare my intention to submit to those laws, and to use my influence with
                the members of the Church over which I preside to have them do likewise.”<a target="_blank"

        <p>
            (It is interesting that the essay takes great care to use the word "inspired" instead of claiming this was a
            revelation from God. The impression of course is that D&C 132 is a true revelation but the ending of the
            practice was more of an inspiration to issue the declaration. This is the same process as the ending of the
            ban of blacks on the priesthood/temple ordinances. Neither of these practices end with true revelation, but
            with "inspiration" from church leaders. This is, of course, very contradictory to how Joseph Smith claimed
            to receive revelation constantly, which begs the question why revelation went from nonstop to a drip after
            his death.)

                The full implications of the document were not apparent at first. The Lord’s way is to speak “line upon
                line; here a little, there a little.”<a target="_blank" class="note-ref"

                    data-scroll-id="note9"><sup class="marker">9</sup></a> Like the beginning of plural marriage in the
                Church, the end of the practice was gradual and incremental, a process filled with difficulties and
                uncertainties.
            </p>
            <p>The Manifesto declared President Woodruff’s intention to submit to the laws of the United States, and new
                plural marriages within that jurisdiction largely came to an end. But a small number of plural marriages
                continued to be performed in Mexico and Canada, under the sanction of some Church leaders. As a rule,
                these marriages were not promoted by Church leaders and were difficult to get approved. Either one or
                both of the spouses who entered into these unions typically had to agree to remain in Canada or Mexico.
                On an exceptional basis, a smaller number of plural marriages were performed within the United States
                between the years 1890 and 1904.
            </p>
            <p>The Church’s role in these marriages became a subject of intense public debate after Reed Smoot, an
                Apostle, was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1903. At the April 1904 general conference, Church President
                Joseph F. Smith issued a forceful statement, known as the Second Manifesto, making new plural marriages
                punishable by excommunication.<a target="_blank" class="note-ref"
                    href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics-essays/plural-marriage-in-the-church-of-jesus-christ-of-latter-day-saints?lang=eng#note10"
                    data-scroll-id="note10"><sup class="marker">10</sup></a> Since President Smith’s day, Church
                Presidents have repeatedly emphasized that the Church and its members are no longer authorized to enter
                into plural marriage and have underscored the sincerity of their words by urging local leaders to bring
                noncompliant members before Church disciplinary councils.
            </p>

        <p>
            This essay ignores how polygamy continued after Woodruff's manifesto was issued even in the United States,
            which is why the carefully worded phrase "largely came to an end" is included. As a matter of fact, Woodruff
            himself was almost certainly married to Madame Mountford in 1897 as all circumstantial evidence points to
            (no public records of a marriage exist for obvious reasons, but journal entries point to a longstanding
            relationship). This is what led to the 1904 second manifesto, because Apostles were still approving
            polygamous marriages because they did not believe the manifesto was the word of God, which also contradicts
            the argument that only the president of the church could authorize polygamous marriages.
            <br><br>
            The essay also ignores that the Mormon church purchased land to create colonies in Mexico in order to
            continue polygamy outside of the United States. The church purchased 100,000 acres of land in Mexico in 1885
            so that polygamy could continue to be safe for saints who wanted to travel from Utah and Arizona. The
            Latter-Day Saints were under threats because of the Mexican Revolution in 1910, so most left and few
            returned later when tensions died down. If the end of polygamy was truly God's word, why were these colonies
            used after the manifesto since they were purchased by the church? D&C contends it's a new and everlasting
            covenant, and the actions of the church until this day give no indication that polygamy was ended for any
            other reason than the pressure of the US government.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>

            <p>
                Plural marriage was among the most challenging aspects of the Restoration. For many who practiced it,
                plural marriage was a trial of faith. It violated both cultural and legal norms, leading to persecution
                and revilement. Despite these hardships, plural marriage benefited the Church in innumerable ways.
                Through the lineage of these 19th-century Saints have come many Latter-day Saints who have been faithful
                to their gospel covenants as righteous mothers and fathers; loyal disciples of Jesus Christ; devoted
                Church members, leaders, and missionaries; and good citizens and prominent public officials. Modern
                Latter-day Saints honor and respect these faithful pioneers who gave so much for their faith, families,
                and community.
            </p>
        </span>

        <p>
            Not only did polygamy violate 'both cultural and legal norms' it violated the norms of God's words. Nowhere
            in the Bible does does command polygamy, and in almost all cases considers it an abomination. Not only that,
            but Joseph Smith and Brigham Young both violated D&C 101 ("Inasmuch as this Church of Christ has been
            reproached with the crime of fornication and polygamy, we declare that we believe that one man should have
            one wife, and one woman but one husband, except in the case of death, when either is at liberty to marry
            again") which was canonized until 1876, but they also violated D&C 132 repeatedly.
            <br><br>
            If the US government did not make it impossible for polygamy to continue, it would be the law of the Mormon
            church to this day. For those women reading this that are in the LDS church, you would be sharing your
            husband right now in a marriage not based on love, but on a promise of exaltation. Your daughters would be
            sought after by leaders by the time they turned 14, and would end up just another wife in a system where
            women are treated like property.
            <br><br>
            There is absolutely no reason to believe that polygamy is from God, and in the Kirtland/Nauvoo annotated
            essay we laid out the case in much more detail. Joseph Smith did not dictate the revelation for a decade
            after he was already known to be in a relationship beyond Emma, and the revelation itself is telling when
            they note that Joseph Smith inquired why some in the Bible have more than one woman. Why would someone seek
            out an answer to that unless they were already wanting to introduce polygamy? Why did God give a revelation
            that this church believes that marriage is just one man and one wife, only to completely reverse course
            shortly after? Why would God make Joseph Smith look so bad with contradictions in His words?
            <br><br>
            Why would God send an angel with a drawn sword for Joseph Smith to enter into more polygamous marriages to
            have sex with other women, when Joseph Smith himself is the one who desired to ask God about it? None of it
            makes sense unless you look for the most obvious conclusion - Joseph Smith created the Book of Mormon and
            continued to create scripture as he created a church. This is clearly explained in our Book of Abraham
            annotated essay, the Book of Mormon translation essay, and even in the First Vision essay. It is also
            apparent in the changing story on the restoration of the priesthood, the many anachornisms of the Book of
            Mormon that just all happen to be things Joseph Smith was familiar with in his lifetime, and the Joseph
            Smith Translation of the Bible that a BYU study discovered was heavily lifted from Adam Clarke's biblical
            commentaries.
            <br><br>
            As we have ended other essays with, we know it is long, and we know it is very difficult to read these
            things that were previously unknown to almost all LDS members. I hope that you will continue to research
            this issue and that you will be willing to research from both LDS and non-LDS sources to get the full
            picture, and read Doctrine and Covenants section 132 in its entirety knowing what is in the two polygamy
            essays and notations we have made. It is impossible to believe that God would allow for this kind of
            behavior that puts intimidation and stress on young women who have to choose between the promise of
            exaltation upon marrying these church leaders or damnation for refusing to enter into a loveless, polygamous
            marriage.
            <br><br>
            The question you have to ask yourself is - if polygamy was introduced again, what kind of life would you
            have? Would you believe Joseph Smith so much that you could endure a marriage to a husband that had sex with
            other women? That had kids with other women? That brought in new women to have sex with? These questions
            seem harsh, but that is the reality of D&C 132 for any women and any daughters they might have. As we have
            shown in these annotated essays, there is no reason to believe that Joseph Smith was a true prophet of God
            and every reason to believe that he was making up revelations to help his own cause when necessary whether
            it be polygamy, Hirum Page's seer stone, commanding Martin Harris to fund the Book of Mormon, avoiding
            travel by water and asking the church to pay for a trip by land (D&C 61), or when the 116 pages were 'lost'
            God just happened to have a second set of plates to cover that exact timeframe.
            <br><br>
            Again, these are difficult issues to tackle, but taken together they paint a very clear picture that is
            impossible to ignore. But it is better to find the truth than to ignore it, as difficult as it might be at
            first. There are many resources to help those going through a faith crisis, so please email us if you would
            like any help. While the church tells us that we will be miserable without it (and "where will you go?"),
            that is the kind of thing a person in abusive relationship would say. The idea that you can't ever be happy
            without it is insulting, especially given the issues pointed out through these essays. The reality is that
            people who do learn the truth and move on are just as (if not more) happy and healthy afterwards. I can tell
            you all reading this that I have been better off since leaving - I feel more confident about myself, I can
            choose to do the right thing because I want to and not because I am told to, and, contrary to church
            teachings, I do not live in sin or laziness. There is life after the church, and while it is a sad
            transition away from something you were raised to believe is the only way, realizing the truth and then
            being able to enjoy those around you and the world around you is more than worth it.
