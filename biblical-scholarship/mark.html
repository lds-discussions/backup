        <h1>The Long Ending of Mark and the Book of Mormon</h1>

        <p>
            As we’ve explored the Book of Mormon’s reliance on the King James Bible (KJV) in previous sections, we’ve
            noted instances where the Book of Mormon incorporates material from the KJV, including translation errors,
            italicized words, and even later additions.
            <br><br>
            In the last section on the Sermon on the Mount, we discussed the conclusion of the Lord’s Prayer in Matthew,
            which is regarded by scholars as a late addition called a doxology. A similar issue arises in the Gospel of
            Mark, where scholars generally agree that the ending found in the King James Bible is a later addition.
            Nonetheless, this material appears verbatim in the Book of Mormon.
            <br><br>
            The “long ending” of Mark has become so widely recognized among scholars as a later addition that some Bible
            translations include a disclaimer stating that the earliest manuscripts and other ancient sources do not
            contain Mark 16:9-20. While a few scholars still contend that the long ending might have been original (a
            discussion we’ll address below), there are numerous reasons why scholarly consensus holds that this section
            of Mark was likely added after the original text was written.
        </p>

        <img src="../book-of-mormon/images/anachronisms-1.webp" alt="mark 16" class="image-style-medium">

        <p>
            This again points to the Book of Mormon being a 19th century text written by someone who owned the King
            James Bible and was familiar with 19th century ideas of Christian beliefs. In the case of the long ending of
            Mark, it shows that the author of the Book of Mormon included late material just as they did with the
            Deutero-Isaiah passages and the late addition to the Lord's Prayer in the Sermon on the Mount.
        </p>

        <h2>Problems with the Book of Mormon's Use of the Long Ending of Mark</h2>

        <p>
            Just as we highlighted the problems with the Book of Mormon’s reliance on the King James Bible, the Long
            Ending of Mark presents a lot of the same issues.
        </p>

        <h3>Historicity of the Long Ending of Mark</h3>

        <p>
            First we want to give a brief overview of why scholars are convinced that the ending of Mark in the King
            James Bible is a late addition. From New Testament scholar Dr. Bart Ehrman:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            "The evidence that shows these verses were not original to Mark is similar in kind to that for the woman
            taken in adultery, and again I don’t need to go into all the details here. It is absent from our two oldest
            and best manuscripts of Mark’s Gospel, along with other important witnesses; the writing style varies from
            what we find elsewhere in Mark; the transition between this passage and the one preceding is hard to
            understand (e.g., Mary Magdalene is introduced in v. 9 as if she hadn’t been mentioned yet, even though she
            is discussed in the preceding verses; there is another problem with the Greek that makes the transition even
            more awkward); and there are a large number of words and phrases in the passage that are not elsewhere found
            in Mark. In short, the evidence is sufficient to convince virtually all textual scholars that these verses
            are an addition to Mark." (<a href="https://ehrmanblog.org/the-ending-of-mark-in-the-king-james-bible/"

                    Bible</em></a>)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This naturally raises numerous questions about the text of the Bible—a topic studied across Christian
            denominations. However, the specific issue with the Book of Mormon is the inclusion of language from verses
            in the Gospel of Mark. These verses were likely appended to the gospel by an unknown scribe centuries after
            the events they describe. Yet, they appear in the Book of Mormon text:
        </p>

        <table border="1" cellpadding="10" style="width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse;">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Bible (Mark 16:17–18, KJV)</th>
                    <th>Book of Mormon (Mormon 9:24)</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <em>17</em> And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out
                        devils; they
                        shall speak with new tongues;
                        <br><br>
                        <em>18</em> They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt
                        them; they
                        shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        And these signs shall follow them that believe—in my name shall they cast out devils; they shall
                        speak with new tongues; they shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing it shall
                        not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover.
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>
            Once more, it's worth emphasizing that the inclusion of King James Bible language in the Book of Mormon is,
            by definition, anachronistic, as the KJV was not produced until 1611. Beyond this, the frequent references
            to New Testament texts and Christology in the Book of Mormon present a challenge: these New Testament books
            were not composed until long after Lehi’s departure, making them inaccessible to anyone within the Book of
            Mormon narrative.
            <br><br>
            As we explored in the section on the King James Bible and the Book of Mormon, one frequent apologetic claim
            is that Jesus could have taught the same exact phrases in the Americas as he did to his followers in
            Jerusalem, making the Sermon at the Temple a retelling of the Sermon on the Mount, “errors and all.” This
            suggests that Jesus would have shared identical phrases, ideas, and teachings with the Nephites—a theory
            that, while seemingly plausible, isn’t supported by textual criticism.
            <br><br>
            Even if we allow for this possibility, for the Book of Mormon to have true authenticity, these phrases in
            Mark would need to be original to the text. Yet, the original text was in Greek. As discussed in the
            previous section on the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus spoke Aramaic, meaning the King James translation is at
            least two translations removed from Jesus’ original words.
            <br><br>
            Thus, not only does the Book of Mormon include these teachings, but it presents them in precisely the same
            wording as the King James Bible—a translation of Greek manuscripts that were themselves derived from
            Aramaic, passed down through oral tradition for decades before being recorded.
            <br><br>
            In short, the likelihood of these words being Jesus’ exact teachings is almost nonexistent, making their
            word-for-word appearance in the Book of Mormon highly problematic.
            <br><br>
            In the case of the long ending of Mark, this anachronism is even more striking. These verses weren’t part of
            Mark’s original text but were added later by a scribe. Like Deutero-Isaiah, Joseph Smith didn’t know that
            the ending of Mark was a later addition. By including this material in the Book of Mormon, he introduced a
            significant historical inaccuracy, as seen through the lens of Biblical scholarship.
            <br><br>
            In other words, Joseph Smith was incorporating verses from the King James Bible into the Book of Mormon that
            the Book of Mormon people couldn’t possibly have known. This includes not only the long ending of Mark but
            also the Lord’s Prayer—passages that were added well after the Gospels’ original compositions.
        </p>

        <h2>Why It Matters</h2>

        <p>
            As with Deutero-Isaiah, Joseph Smith includes text that simply would not have been accessible to the Book of
            Mormon people. Taken together, these instances unmistakably reveal Joseph Smith’s imprint throughout the
            Book of Mormon, a pattern we’ll continue to observe as we delve further into its text.
            <br><br>
            For example, the Book of Mormon refers to Columbus discovering America (1 Nephi 13:12) and recounts the
            founding of the United States (1 Nephi 13:14-19). Yet, once we reach Joseph Smith’s own timeline, no such
            prophecies address the Civil War, the world wars, or the rapid advances in technology, transportation, or
            globalization.
            <br><br>
            Critics often note that Joseph Smith draws heavily from the King James Bible in crafting the Book of
            Mormon’s narrative. We highlight this frequently on our site. Apologists may dismiss these instances, as we
            mentioned, by arguing that Joseph Smith received the Book of Mormon through revelation and thus filtered it
            through his own understanding.
            <br><br>
            However, this argument falters when we find both text and concepts in the Book of Mormon that not only
            predate Lehi’s departure but, as in the case of Mark, were composed centuries after the first Gospel
            manuscripts were written.
        </p>

        <h3>Apologetic Responses on the Long Ending of Mark in the Book of Mormon</h3>

        <p>
            We typically start with the Gospel Topics essays or FAIR Mormon for the most widely used apologetics, and in
            this case FAIR integrates an article written by Book of Mormon central (<a
                href="https://www.fairlatterdaysaints.org/answers/Question:_Why_does_part_of_the_longer_ending_of_Mark_show_up_in_the_Book_of_Mormon%3F"
                target="_blank">FAIR. <em>Question: Why does part of the longer ending of Mark show up in the Book of
                    Mormon?</em></a>)
            , where they give a few reasons why
            this should not damage the testimony of members. From FAIR:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            "In recent years, several scholars have argued that the text in Mark 16:9–20 is indeed an authentic part of
            the Gospel of Mark."
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            The problem with this line of reasoning is that it’s always possible to find a few scholars who will argue
            for almost any position, particularly when there’s a desire to interpret the Bible as untarnished literal
            history, immune from scholarly critique and textual analysis. Take the Book of Abraham, for instance. Some
            scholars still argue for a "long scroll" containing the original writings of Abraham, but the vast majority
            agree that the papyri fragments and other evidence debunk this "long/lost scroll" theory as implausible.
            <br><br>
            At this point, there’s not much left to say. Book of Mormon Central continues by noting, "these scholars
            note that many other early New Testament manuscripts contain these verses," but this doesn’t make the case
            they intend. A later scribe aiming to authenticate the long ending of Mark would logically borrow from early
            sources to lend credibility to the new text, incorporating material that best suited this goal. This
            argument is comparable to claiming the Book of Mormon is authentic simply because it includes verses and
            ideas from early Christianity and the King James Bible. In reality, this only reveals that a later author,
            familiar with those concepts and texts, crafted a pseudepigraphical work resembling an ancient text.

            FAIR and Book of Mormon Central add:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            "It is also significant that several scholars who reject Mark 16:9–20 as part of the original Gospel of Mark
            nonetheless believe that the long ending pre-existed its attachment to Mark"
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Once again, this reliance on "several scholars" serves to diminish the overwhelming scholarly consensus that
            the ending of Mark was a later addition. As Dr. Bart Ehrman observes:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            "Some scholars agree with the scribes in thinking that 16:8 is too abrupt an ending for a Gospel. As I
            indicated, it is not that these scholars believe the final twelve verses in our later manuscripts were the
            original ending – they know that that’s not the case. But they think that possibly the last page of Mark’s
            Gospel, one in which Jesus actually did meet the disciples in Galilee, was somehow lost, and that all of our
            copies of the Gospel go back to this one truncated manuscript, without the last page."
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            In other words, it’s highly unlikely that the original ending of Mark vanished, went undiscovered for
            centuries, and was then seamlessly reintegrated. Given the historical challenges in the Gospel’s early
            copying and circulation, where backup copies didn’t exist as they would in modern times, this scenario is
            implausible.
            <br><br>
            If Book of Mormon Central argues for an alternative ending to Mark, they must explain why the Book of Mormon
            mirrors the exact King James Bible wording. The verses in question were added by a scribe hundreds of years
            later, and Joseph Smith’s use of a translation unavailable until 1611 only underscores the issue. Suggesting
            that an original ending to Mark was lost still doesn’t help the Book of Mormon’s case, as the phrasing it
            uses would only have been appended later.
            <br><br>
            Another point raised by FAIR/Book of Mormon Central is:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            "Another important detail to keep in mind is that even among those who reject the authenticity of Mark
            16:9–20, there is considerable debate about how the Gospel of Mark originally ended."
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This approach, which mirrors the church’s style in the Book of Abraham essay, presents fragmented arguments
            lacking consensus, hoping readers will settle on one and feel reassured. However, even if Mark’s ending was
            different, it wouldn’t substantiate ancient claims in the Book of Mormon. Unless one believes an original
            ending with the exact King James wording was somehow lost and rediscovered without alteration, Joseph Smith
            made a serious error by including it in the Book of Mormon.
            <br><br>
            The last point from FAIR/Book of Mormon Central reads:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            It important to recognize, however, that even though the English translation of Mormon 9:22–24 was possibly
            influenced by the King James translation of Mark 16:15–18, Moroni’s source was not the Gospel of Mark.
            Rather, Moroni was drawing on the teachings of Christ recorded among the Nephites (Mormon 9:22). Thus, the
            authenticity of the words of Jesus in Mormon 9:22–25 is not ultimately dependent on the authenticity of the
            “long ending” of Mark. Indeed, belief in the authenticity of these words in the ending of Mark may, on the
            other hand, benefit from the testimony of the Book of Mormon.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This is simply untrue. We know the Book of Mormon translation was influenced by the King James Bible, making
            "possibly" here a weasel word. This language is similar to the church’s claim in its polygamy essay that
            Emma "likely" didn’t know of all of Joseph Smith’s wives, despite ample evidence suggesting otherwise. This
            illustrates how apologetic arguments often function. In this case, there is no “possibly,” as the verse from
            Mormon is identical to the long ending of Mark, showing the King James Bible’s clear influence.
            <br><br>
            Moreover, a recurring issue in the Book of Mormon is how frequently Jesus’ teachings to the Nephites echo
            those found in the Bible. As discussed in the Sermon at the Temple section, critics point out this problem
            when comparing it to the Sermon on the Mount; it’s nearly identical, with only minor changes. The Sermon at
            the Temple, sourced almost exclusively from Matthew’s account rather than Luke’s additional teachings,
            exemplifies this issue.
            <br><br>
            FAIR’s editorial footnote (#13) further claims:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            It is unreasonable to believe, and there is no evidence, that Joseph either opened a Bible to the ending of
            Mark and read these words, or had memorized them, and then wove them smoothly into the flow of the
            translation of Mormon.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This argument, however, is difficult to accept, given the abundance of King James Bible passages in the Book
            of Mormon. The notion that Joseph Smith did not use a Bible to incorporate these verses strains logic and
            common sense, leaving us with two plausible explanations:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                God preserved the gold plates for thousands of years only to reveal the text through a hat-stone process
                that replicated the King James Bible, including translation errors, italics, and late additions.
            </li>
            <li>
                Joseph Smith incorporated lengthy Bible phrases as needed, suggesting he used the King James Bible
                during the Book of Mormon’s composition.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            The church claims the Book of Mormon is "the most correct book on Earth," while the Bible is God’s word "as
            far as it is translated correctly." Yet, if the Book of Mormon is an ancient record, why does it rely so
            heavily on the King James Bible translation, known to contain errors?
            <br><br>
            Lastly, Book of Mormon Central’s circular logic is concerning. They argue that the long ending of Mark is
            authentic because the Book of Mormon is correct, disregarding that the Book of Mormon depends on the King
            James Bible. By this reasoning, if the Book of Mormon uses an inauthentic biblical passage, how can its
            authenticity as an ancient record be sustained?
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <p>
            The recurring issue of New Testament references in the Book of Mormon continues to highlight its reliance on
            the King James Bible, with the use of the long ending of Mark serving as another clear sign that the author
            had access to this specific translation.
            <br><br>
            In apologetics, there’s often a “divide and conquer” strategy that attempts to address each issue
            individually. However, these issues are interconnected. For instance, the "Sermon at the Temple" in the Book
            of Mormon mirrors the Sermon on the Mount, complete with italicized phrases, late additions, and language
            irrelevant to ancient Americas. The long ending of Mark, copied exactly from the KJV, is further evidence of
            the author’s familiarity with this text.
            <br><br>
            Most Christian denominations today acknowledge these textual issues, as reflected in modern Bible
            translations that include footnotes noting that certain passages, like the long ending of Mark, weren’t
            present in original manuscripts. But in the Book of Mormon, these passages appear as integral parts of an
            ancient narrative. This not only presents a significant issue but also suggests that the book was crafted by
            someone rooted in a 19th-century context.
            <br><br>
            Consider this: if another religious group presented an “ancient text” claimed to be divinely preserved, and
            you found much of it derived from modern Bible translations, would you accept their claims? Examining the
            church’s truth claims with the same scrutiny we apply to other organizations reveals how these issues are
            pervasive across not only the Book of Mormon but also texts like the Book of Abraham, Moses, and Doctrine
            and Covenants.
            <br><br>
            If the Book of Mormon is meant to be an ancient text, why does it rely so heavily on the King James Bible—a
            translation even church leaders admit is riddled with errors? Accepting Book of Mormon Central’s position
            requires addressing why God would allow so many translation errors to enter the Book of Mormon through
            Joseph Smith’s revelatory process.
            <br><br>
            Furthermore, the reasoning presented by Book of Mormon Central is circular: they argue that the long ending
            of Mark is accurate because the Book of Mormon is accurate, yet the Book of Mormon itself depends on the
            King James Bible. By their logic, if this part of the Bible is inauthentic, the use of it in the Book of
            Mormon undermines the claim that it’s an ancient record.

        <p>
            I understand that this process can be difficult and disillusioning, especially when questioning a faith you
            were raised in or converted to. However, if the church is true, there should be no fear in engaging with
            these materials. As Apostle James Talmage wisely stated:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “The man who cannot listen to an argument which opposes his views either has a weak position or is a weak
            defender of it. No opinion that cannot stand discussion or criticism is worth holding. And it has been
            wisely said that the man who knows only half of any question is worse off than the man who knows nothing of
            it. He is not only one sided, but his partisanship soon turns him into an intolerant and a fanatic. In
            general it is true that nothing which cannot stand up under discussion and criticism is worth defending.”

            I couldn’t agree more, and I hope members will approach these
            pages with an open heart and mind.
