        <figcaption>The Prophet Isaiah</figcaption>


        <p>
            The Book of Mormon incorporates numerous chapters from the Book of Isaiah, directly quoting passages from
            the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. These quotations even include translation errors, which would
            have been impossible to inscribe on the original gold plates, as the KJV did not exist until thousands of
            years after the plates were reportedly created. This issue directly challenges the Book of Mormon's claim of
            divine translation, as it contradicts the described process Joseph Smith used. According to the narrative,
            he would place a "seer stone" in a hat, then lower his face into the hat to block out light, reading aloud
            only the words that appeared on the stone. Words would only change once they were written correctly, meaning
            Smith had no opportunity to switch between using the seer stone and copying from the KJV Bible.
            <br><br>
            When Isaiah chapters appear in the Book of Mormon, they unmistakably resemble KJV language, as outlined in
            discussions on the King James Bible section. The initial chapters of Isaiah (1–39) are attributed to a
            historical Isaiah, while scholars believe chapters 40–55 (Deutero-Isaiah) and 56–66 (Trito-Isaiah) were
            authored by later writers. Scholars date the original Isaiah to the 8th and 7th centuries BCE, with
            Deutero-Isaiah composed after the Babylonian exile (586 BCE). Since the brass plates were taken from Laban
            in 600 BCE, this raises significant issues, as the Book of Mormon extensively cites Deutero-Isaiah chapters
            that weren’t yet written at the time of Lehi’s departure.
            <br><br>
            For instance, in 2 Nephi 1:13–14,23, Lehi quotes Deutero-Isaiah material, while Jacob reads from it in 2
            Nephi 8. These passages are not only from Deutero-Isaiah but also mirror the exact wording from the KJV,
            including mistranslations, italicized text, and some late additions—elements unique to the KJV.
            <br><br>
            Deutero-Isaiah's influence in the Book of Mormon extends beyond direct quotations by Lehi and Jacob. For
            example, 2 Nephi 8:24–25 mirrors Isaiah 52:1–2 from the KJV:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            24 Awake, awake, put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city; for
            henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean.

            25 Shake thyself from the dust; arise, sit down, O Jerusalem; loose thyself from the bands of thy neck, O
            captive daughter of Zion.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            These verses are not exclusive to 2 Nephi; significant portions of Isaiah 52 are also cited by Jesus in 3
            Nephi, and Isaiah 52:24 is quoted in Moroni 10:31. If these sections of Isaiah were composed after Lehi's
            time, it introduces a considerable anachronism, suggesting the author of the Book of Mormon was using
            material accessible in the 19th century, namely the KJV Bible.
            <br><br>
            While the inclusion of KJV chapters and verses in the Book of Mormon already casts doubt on its
            authenticity, the use of Deutero-Isaiah amplifies this issue. The later composition of these chapters
            indicates they could not have been present on the plates taken by Lehi, marking this inclusion as a critical
            anachronism. This issue parallels the controversies surrounding the Book of Abraham, where Joseph Smith
            likely lacked knowledge of biblical history that later scholarship would reveal, inadvertently introducing
            late additions into the Book of Mormon.
        </p>

        <h2>Problems with Deutero-Isaiah and the Book of Mormon</h2>

        <p>
            The problem with Deutero-Isaiah, just as we saw with late additions to the Sermon on the Mount and the long
            ending of Mark in previous sections, is that we have more examples where Joseph Smith not only copied source
            material, but copied material that has no historical basis to be in the Book of Mormon. For a brief overview
            of the Deutero-Isaiah problem, I highly recommend reading biblical scholar and former CES instructor Dr.
            David Bokovoy's two part write-up on Deutero-Isaiah from 2016. Those two articles can be read at:

            <em>The Truthfulness of Deutero-Isaiah: A Response to Kent Jackson (part 2)</em></a>

        <blockquote>
            One of the most insightful perspectives held by mainstream biblical scholars involves the historical
            development of the book of Isaiah. Since the 20th century, all mainstream scholars have held the position
            that chapters 40-66 were written after the Jewish exile into Babylon (c.a. 586 BCE). Scholars typically
            identify the exilic material in 40-55 by the title Deutero-Isaiah, and the post-exilic material in 56-66 by
            the title Trito-Isaiah (though these works may have been written by multiple authors). This means, of
            course, that the second half of the book of Isaiah was not written by the historical Isaiah, a prophet who
            lived in Jerusalem during the eighth century BCE. For Latter-day Saints, this presents a direct challenge
            for traditionally held paradigms concerning the Book of Mormon, since some of this material is not only
            attributed to Isaiah, it has had a significant impact upon the Book of Mormon. If mainstream scholars are
            correct then this material would not have been available to Lehi’s family as something they could have taken
            with them to America.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            The reasons that scholars can date this material to the post-exilic time frame are multiple, and I want to
            quickly summarize them here:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Chapter 45 of Isaiah mentioned Cyrus, the king that would liberate the Jews, by name. This indicates
                that the writer of this material was aware of this historical event, which is why they could give such
                specifics such as writing Cyrus by name.
            </li>
            <li>
                In 1879, the Cyrus Cylinder was discovered in the Middle East, which was created sometime between
                539-538 BCE. It is written in Akkadian, the language of the Babylonians, and gives more historical
                context to the material in Deutero-Isaiah. In Dr. Bokovoy's Deutero-Isaiah piece, he outlines how the
                context allows scholars to see that Deutero-Isaiah was written after the Cyrus Cylinder was created, as
                Deutero-Isaiah serves as a "polemic that belittles other gods and vindicates Israel’s deity Yahweh is
                one of the main themes that ties Isaiah 40-55 together as a literary unit."
            </li>
            <li>
                As Dr. Bokovoy explains, the historical Isaiah believed in the “the inviolability of Jerusalem.” He did
                not believe Jerusalem would ever be destroyed as it was sacred. Yet "Isaiah 40 begins as a message of
                comfort to the Judean people since Jerusalem had been destroyed. But this was not something that the
                historical Isaiah believed would happen." Furthermore, "Surely, if his theology switched so drastically
                we would expect some sort of statement that explained how he came to know that his earlier oracles were
                incorrect. In reality, chapters 40-66 never speak of the Babylonian period as a distant future reality,
                as if someone were prophesying about it. Instead, the Babylonian period is described as the present,
                historical condition."
            </li>
            <li>
                The influence of Jeremiah on Deutero-Isaiah material presents a timeline issue as Jeremiah lived after
                the historical Isaiah. This is an anachronism that allows scholars to date the Deutero-Isaiah material
                as the author was aware of Jeremiah's teachings, and the writings of Jeremiah make clear that Jeremiah
                did not know of the events in Deutero-Isaiah.
            </li>
            <li>
                The use of Aramaic language begins in the Deutero-Isaiah chapters, whereas it is absent in the first 30
                chapters. From Dr. Bokovoy: "Unlike what we find in the first half of the book of Isaiah, Aramaic has
                heavily influenced the language in Isaiah 40-66. Not only does this fact provide compelling proof that
                the material in 40-66 was written by other authors, it shows that these authors were living in a time
                when Jews were speaking Aramaic."
            </li>
            <li>
                Similar to use of Aramaic, the Deutero-Isaiah material is written in a form of Hebrew that dates to the
                postexilic times. From Dr. Bokovoy: "Unlike what we encounter in the historical oracles of Isaiah, the
                material in Isaiah 40-66 contains many, many examples of Hebrew words and phrases that appear solely in
                the exilic and postexilic periods."
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            I highly recommend reading Dr. Bokovoy's two-part response on Deutero-Isaiah, linked above. These articles
            are brief but provide valuable context and details expanding on the bullet points above, illustrating why
            scholars are nearly unanimous in accepting both Deutero- and Trito-Isaiah authorship.
            <br><br>
            One additional reason supporting the view that Deutero- and Trito-Isaiah were written after the time of the
            historical Isaiah is that Abraham is never mentioned in the first 39 chapters of Isaiah but appears multiple
            times in the Deutero-Isaiah material. As noted earlier, the Book of Genesis likely wasn’t composed until the
            6th century, while Isaiah is traditionally believed to have lived in the 8th and 7th centuries BCE.
            <br><br>
            Similar to our discussion on Adam and Eve, examining the earliest biblical writings reveals that the authors
            were likely unaware of some of the stories and characters in Genesis. Abraham is another example: he isn’t
            mentioned in the historical Isaiah’s 39 chapters, as his story would not have been known at that time. In
            contrast, Deutero- and Trito-Isaiah refer to Abraham as early as chapter 41 and again in chapters 51 and 63.
            This suggests that these sections of Isaiah can be dated to the 6th century, as the author, writing in
            Isaiah’s name, includes Abraham, whose story emerged later.
            <br><br>
            As previously covered on this site, a key issue for apologists is that the Book of Mormon translation must
            be either a ‘tight’ or ‘loose’ translation, but it cannot be both. Witnesses describe Joseph Smith reading
            from a stone in his hat, suggesting a tight translation where words only changed once correctly transcribed.
            Yet, as discussed in the KJV section, apologists also argue for a loose translation, where Joseph Smith was
            inspired and thus included familiar sources in the Book of Mormon. A loose translation would also account
            for the many anachronisms in the Book of Mormon, such as horses, wheels, chariots, bees, silk, steel,
            elephants, swine, wheat, and iron—elements that could be attributed to Joseph Smith loosely translating
            based on his own knowledge.
            <br><br>
            However, given the specific accounts of how the Book of Mormon was translated, a loose translation does not
            fit. This leaves us with a tight translation model, where there should be no King James Version errors from
            Joseph’s 1769 Bible, and certainly no chapters written after Lehi’s departure. This creates a significant
            anachronism within the Book of Mormon, making it clear that Joseph Smith was drawing from his Bible rather
            than transcribing an ancient text preserved on golden plates for over a millennium.

        <h2>
            Apologetic Claims to Deutero-Isaiah in the Book of Mormon
        </h2>

        <p>
            There are a few different approaches that apologists have taken to the Book of Mormon, and we want to
            highlight them here and note why we feel it is insufficient to explaining such a difficult problem:
            <br><br>
            FAIR has a somewhat lengthy write-up of the problem (<a
                href="https://www.fairlatterdaysaints.org/answers/Isaiah_and_the_Book_of_Mormon" target="_blank">FAIR.
                <em>Isaiah and the Book of Mormon</em></a>), and a few highlights are below:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            The primary Isaiah passages found in the Book of Mormon are illustrated in the accompanying table.

                    class="image-style-medium"></figure>
            <figcaption>Isaiah passages found in the Book of Mormon</figcaption>

            2 Nephi 12-24 quotes 1st Isaiah. This is not a problem because it is agreed by scholars that this author
            wrote before Nephi obtained the brass plates.<strong>1 Nephi 20-21, 2 Nephi 7-2 Nephi 8, and 3 Nephi
                16꞉18-20all
                quote from 2nd Isaiah, which is a problem if those chapters were not written by 2nd Isaiah until after
                Nephi
                had obtained the brass plates.</strong> [...]
            <br><br>
            Understanding the proposed development of the text of Isaiah may be helpful:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    1st Isaiah wrote during a time when a powerful nation, Assyria, threatened the destruction of
                    Israel. While this was the immediate issue in 1st Isaiah's mind, he also may have been inspired to
                    make general prophecies about a more future destruction of Israel. While not specifically mentioning
                    "Bablyon" or "Cyrus", this 1st Isaiah may have made broad prophecies about a future threat to Israel
                    separate from the immediate Assyrian threat.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Latter-day Saints scholar Sidney B. Sperry has suggested that we pay attention to the research of
                    several non-Latter-day Saint scholars who "held that Isaiah 40-66 arose in exilic times, but
                    consisted in considerable measure of ancient prophecies of Isaiah, which were reproduced by an
                    author of Isaiah's school living in the exilic period, because the events of the day were bringing
                    fulfillment of the prophecies." In other words, our current Isaiah 40-55 (or 40-66) may originate in
                    primitive writings of 1st Isaiah, but they were reworked and reinterpreted by 2nd Isaiah [...]
                </li>
            </ul>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            he problem here is that we are assuming a theory that only complicates the plausibility further. This theory
            assumes that the writings were done in primitive times, reworked after they left Jerusalem, but still were
            integrated into the Book of Mormon because they are based on writings that were done ahead of time? This is
            a repeat of the apologetics about the long ending of Mark, where apologists argued that the "long" ending
            was originally written, lost in the earliest manuscripts, but then reattached later by a scribe who realized
            it was missing.
            <br><br>
            What this argument attempts to do is give plausibility that the text of Deutero-Isaiah was originated
            earlier but changed as prophecies were fulfilled, but the more obvious answer is that the author of
            Deutero-Isaiah is writing in his own time with the knowledge of events happening around him. It is similar
            to how the Book of Mormon prophecies of both the arrival of Columbus and the founding of America, but is
            noticeably vague on prophecies that go beyond the years it was produced.
            <br><br>
            I also want to note the use of "several non-LDS scholars" in FAIR's write-up, because as we noted in the
            long ending of Mark section, this is a common apologetic move to ignore the consensus by cherry-picking the
            few scholars who agree with the church's foundational truth claims. You can find "several scholars" who will
            agree with you on anything, but Occam's Razor would tell us that if you have to ignore the consensus on
            issue after issue, it's because your truth claims are not holding up to the evidence.
            <br><br>
            FAIR then dives into the tight vs loose translation methods:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            "The answer to this question will involve a brief consideration of the translation process of the Book of
            Mormon. There are two major methods that have been proposed for the translation of the Book of Mormon. The
            first is a "tight-control" method in which the text of the English version strictly matches the text of the
            gold plates, often right down to the spelling of names. The second method of translation is "loose-control",
            in which the English translation is a bit more fluid and matches the general meaning of the original
            reformed Egyptian text but may not strictly follow every word. Latter-day saint scholars and students fall
            into both camps, and some believe that both methods could have been used throughout the translation of the
            Book of Mormon. This is relevant to the question of Isaiah in the Book of Mormon because a "loose-control"
            theory, or something similar to it, would help account for why we have the KJV of Isaiah in the Book of
            Mormon, as discussed below."
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This, as we discussed above, does not work. First, FAIR talks about the text of the gold plates without
            mentioning that they were never used in the translation. The only translation method used for the Book of
            Mormon was the stone in Joseph's hat, which is not in dispute even though the church and apologists continue
            to use the above narrative for missionary work or lessons. Thus, there is no way for the loose translation
            to work, which is why this theory by apologists not only can't work, but would be contradicted by other
            responses on FAIR's site.
            <br><br>
            I brought this up in the long ending of Mark section, but again I want to point out how apologetics will
            jump between theories as necessary to answer individual problems, but when they are taken in totality will
            contradict themselves repeatedly. In the case of a loose vs tight translation theory, you can see it here
            where they argue that Joseph Smith must have a loose translation because of the obvious use of the King
            James Bible, but in the earlier King James Bible section they argue that no Bible was used when producing
            the Book of Mormon. While apologists want you to look at these problems in isolation, it is very important
            to look at the issues together to understand not just how irreconcilable they are, but how inconsistent the
            apologetic responses are in these different topics.
            <br><br>
            FAIR goes on to give a proposed scenario to try and make this work:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    As Joseph was translating the text of the Book of Mormon, he would find himself translating
                    something that he recognized as being roughly similar to texts from the Bible. This would occur most
                    prominently when Nephi quotes from Isaiah.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Instead of translating Nephi's quotations of Isaiah, Joseph, deferred to the KJV translation of
                    those chapters. This may have been done to save time and to respect the quality of the KJV Bible.
                    The chapters of Isaiah that we find in the Book of Mormon were taken largely by Joseph Smith from
                    the KJV Bible, instead of being translated from Nephi's version of that text. In other words, why
                    reinvent the wheel when the work has already been done?
                </li>
                <li>
                    f Joseph Smith did this while translating the Book of Mormon, it would fall under the broad contours
                    of the "loose-control" theory of the Book of Mormon.
                </li>
                <li>
                    As a result of this, the Isaiah chapters on Nephi's plates would have looked slightly different from
                    the Isaiah chapters that we have now in the Book of Mormon. Remember, the only 2nd Isaiah chapters
                    that show up in the Book of Mormon are Isaiah 48-52. Nephi's version of Isaiah 48-52 that he quoted
                    on his plates was the primitive, early version written by 1st Isaiah which did not include specific
                    references to Babylon. The version of Isaiah 48-52 that we have now in the Book of Mormon is not
                    taken from Nephi's plates, but rather copied from the KJV Bible for reasons suggested above. That
                    version of Isaiah 48-52 is the older, reworked material of 2nd Isaiah which inserted specific
                    references to Babylon.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            It’s understandable why FAIR presents this scenario, but it contradicts both historical context and the
            primary purpose for the Book of Mormon. FAIR suggests that Joseph Smith noticed Nephi quoting Isaiah and
            switched to the Bible to save time. However, this implies that despite Joseph Smith's comments on the
            Bible’s translation issues, he opted to use it to streamline his work. This is difficult to reconcile—if the
            Book of Mormon is "the most correct book on Earth," why would 10-20% of it be drawn from the 1611 King James
            Bible, complete with its errors, italicized words, and later additions?
            <br><br>
            FAIR's theory relies on the loose translation approach, a popular explanation among apologists to justify
            translation inconsistencies. This idea lacks validation in early church history and only emerged as a
            response to translation issues. To reconcile switching between source materials, literal gold plates would
            have been necessary, as it's unclear how else Smith could seamlessly transition with only a seer stone in
            hand. Furthermore, if the seer stone was providing the translation, would it not have been faster than
            reading from the King James Bible to a scribe? When considered carefully, FAIR’s argument falls apart.
            <br><br>
            Additionally, FAIR implies that the plates held the original writings, but Joseph Smith simply missed these
            by using the KJV, suggesting he may have either overlooked key differences or considered accurate
            translation unnecessary. This assumption questions the translation method described in church history,
            implying either oversight or disregard for precise translation.
            <br><br>
            This scenario further implies that God went to great lengths—not only allowing Laban to be killed for the
            brass plates but also preserving the gold plates for over a thousand years—only to have the person chosen to
            restore this record rely on an imperfect Bible translation for "convenience." Are we to believe that God
            would permit an ancient record to be altered for Joseph Smith's convenience, as suggested in the gospel
            topics essay? When examined together, these apologetics become not only implausible but absurd.

        <h2>2 Nephi and the Deutero-Isaiah Problem in the Book of Mormon, By Common Consent</h2>

        <p>
            Regarding 2 Nephi and the Deutero-Isaiah problem,<a
                href="https://bycommonconsent.com/2016/02/12/2-nephi-and-the-deutero-isaiah-problem-in-the-book-of-mormon-bom2016/"
                target="_blank"> <em>By Common Consent</em></a> highlights a perspective from LDS
            apologist Grant Hardy. In Understanding the Book of Mormon, Hardy admits the Deutero-Isaiah issue is more
            significant than many apologists acknowledge. He suggests that faithful Latter-day Saints might:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “is to acknowledge that we probably know less about what constitutes an ‘inspired translation’ than we do
            about Ancient Israel. Once one accepts the possibility of divine intervention, the theology can accommodate
            the (always tentative) results of scholarship.”
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This sentiment aligns with conclusions in official church Gospel Topics essays, which acknowledge historical
            issues but encourage members to lean on personal feelings and testimony. While it's true that not all things
            are clear, the problem is that, with the Book of Mormon, much is visible—showing historical inconsistencies.
            It’s misleading to ask members to accept divine intervention when we have a clear pattern of Joseph Smith
            using existing materials and presenting them as ancient scripture.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <p>
            This brings us back to a recurring issue with Joseph Smith’s works: many foundational scriptures and
            doctrines in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are heavily influenced by external sources and
            are marked by anachronisms from Smith’s time.
            <br><br>
            As covered here, it’s evident that Joseph Smith drew substantial material from the King James Bible,
            including mistranslations, errors, and italicized words. Scholars have identified late additions like the
            expanded Lord’s Prayer in the Sermon on the Mount and the long ending of Mark, both of which appear in the
            Book of Mormon.
            <br><br>
            In following sections, we’ll explore how this pattern continues, with Smith drawing from contemporary
            sources (including the King James Bible) for the Book of Abraham and the Joseph Smith Translation of the
            Bible. This extends beyond scriptures to include narratives of the First Vision, the restoration of the
            priesthood, and temple rituals.
            <br><br>
            In studying biblical scholarship and Mormonism, we can trace the authorship of the Book of Mormon back to
            the time it was created, reflecting the worldview of its author. This is evident here, as the Book of Mormon
            incorporates Isaiah material directly from the King James Bible, including sections that scholars now date
            to after Lehi’s time. And as we continue through the Book of Mormon, Abraham, and Moses, these historical
            inconsistencies only become more pronounced.
        </p>

        <!--call to reflection-->
        <p>
            I understand that this process can be difficult and disillusioning, especially when questioning a faith you
            were raised in or converted to. However, if the church is true, there should be no fear in engaging with
            these materials. As Apostle James Talmage wisely stated:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “The man who cannot listen to an argument which opposes his views either has a weak position or is a weak
            defender of it. No opinion that cannot stand discussion or criticism is worth holding. And it has been
            wisely said that the man who knows only half of any question is worse off than the man who knows nothing of
            it. He is not only one sided, but his partisanship soon turns him into an intolerant and a fanatic. In
            general it is true that nothing which cannot stand up under discussion and criticism is worth defending.”

            I couldn’t agree more, and I hope members will approach these
            pages with an open heart and mind.
