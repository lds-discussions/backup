        <h1>The Book of Mormon and the Tower of Babel</h1>

        <p>
            The Tower of Babel, as described in Genesis 11, is a well-known biblical story that seeks to explain the
            origin of diverse languages among ancient civilizations. According to various interpretations, the event is
            believed to have taken place around 2400–2200 BCE, approximately 100 years after the supposed global flood.
            <br><br>
            However, most biblical scholars, and virtually all secular scholars, view the Tower of Babel narrative as an
            "etiological myth"—a type of myth meant to explain natural phenomena, in this case, the existence of
            multiple languages. This story shares similarities with myths from other cultures that attempt to account
            for the diversity of languages. The Genesis account, for example, is likely influenced by earlier Sumerian
            and Assyrian traditions.
            <br><br>
            For the Tower of Babel to be accepted as a literal historical event, as required by the Book of Mormon,
            which links the story to the migration of the Jaredites and the records in the Book of Ether, significant
            historical issues must be addressed.
        </p>

        <h2>Issues with the Tower of Babel as a Historical Event</h2>

        <p>
            Numerous factors challenge the idea that the Tower of Babel was a real, historical event. First, the
            evidence suggests that there was already a significant diversity of languages well before the Tower of Babel
            would have taken place. Written records of Sumerian date back to 3500 BCE, Egyptian to 3300 BCE, Akkadian to
            2800 BCE, and both Canaanite and Eblaite to around 2400 BCE. Since these languages were spoken long before
            they were written, their origins predate the timeline of the Tower of Babel. (<a

                target="_blank">Wikipedia. <em>List of languages by first written account</em></a>)
            <br><br>
            Additionally, even the biblical text itself, in Genesis 10, acknowledges the existence of multiple languages
            prior to the Tower of Babel:

            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            This further complicates the notion that the Tower of Babel was the singular event that introduced
            linguistic diversity.
            <br><br>
            Though traditionally attributed to Moses, who lived around 1391–1271 BCE, the Book of Genesis is now
            believed by most scholars to have been compiled much later, likely in the 6th or 5th century BCE, as part of
            the broader composition of the Pentateuch (Davies, G.I., <em>"Introduction to the Pentateuch"</em>).
            <br><br>
            The story also assumes a post-flood scenario in which Noah's descendants, speaking a single "Adamic"
            language, constructed the tower. Based on biblical genealogies, there were about 70 descendants of Noah's
            sons—Shem, Ham, and Japheth—by the time of the Babel event. Even if half of their offspring were women, this
            would mean only about 150 people were involved in building the tower.
            <br><br>
            However, historical population estimates suggest a far different scenario. By 3000 BCE, the world’s
            population was between 14 and 45 million, and by 2000 BCE, it had grown to 27–72 million (<a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimates_of_historical_world_population" target="_blank">Wikipedia.
                <em>Estimates of historical world population</em></a>). Additionally,
            there is no evidence of a global flood wiping out humanity. Instead, archaeological evidence points to a
            thriving world filled with diverse civilizations and languages long before the proposed time of the Tower of
            Babel.
            <br><br>
            Moreover, similar myths about the confusion of languages exist in other cultures. The Sumerian myth
            "Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta," written around 2100 BCE, tells of a time when the lord called upon the
            gods to reunite the languages of the world. An Assyrian myth from the 8th century BCE also discusses the
            confounding of tongues:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “Of him, his heart was evil,
            <br>
            […] against the father of all the gods was wicked,
            <br>
            […] of him, his heart was evil,
            <br>
            […] Babylon brought to subjection,
            <br>
            [small] and great he confounded their speech.
            <br>
            […] Babylon brought to subjection,
            <br>
            [small] and great he confounded their speech.
            <br>
            Their strong place (tower) all the day they founded;
            <br>
            to their strong place in the night
            <br>
            entirely he made an end.
            <br>
            In his anger also word thus he poured out:
            <br>
            [to] scatter abroad he set his face
            <br>
            he gave this? command, their counsel was confused
            <br>
            […] the course he broke
            <br>
            […] fixed the sanctuary “

        </blockquote>

        <p>
            The Assyrian myth in question dates back to the 8th century BCE. At first glance, this seems later than the
            Tower of Babel story. However, scholarship has shown that the "five books of Moses" were almost certainly
            compiled during the 6th or 5th century BCE.
            <br><br>
            Former CES instructor and biblical scholar David Bokovoy has suggested that the Tower of Babel narrative is
            a Babylonian critique of ziggurat worship. This idea aligns with the scholarly belief that Etemenanki, a
            ziggurat dedicated to Marduk in Babylon, likely influenced the Babel story. Etemenanki was notably rebuilt
            by Nabopolassar and Nebuchadnezzar II during the 6th century BCE, a period that coincides with the Hebrew
            captivity in Babylon. Scholars like Stephen L. Harris argue that the biblical Tower of Babel account was
            likely shaped by this connection to Etemenanki. (<a href="https://madainproject.com/tower_of_babel_stele"
                target="_blank">Madain Project. <em>Tower of Babel Stele</em></a>)
            <br><br>
            These historical and scholarly findings challenge the idea of a literal Tower of Babel. As evidence mounts,
            biblical scholars increasingly conclude that the story is mythological rather than historical.
        </p>

        <h2>The Tower of Babel and the Book of Mormon</h2>

        <p>
            As we’ve noted, most biblical and secular scholars, along with linguistic experts, agree that the Tower of
            Babel story is an etiological myth, intended to explain the origin of different languages. Many religious
            traditions can reconcile this by focusing on the moral lesson of human pride while acknowledging the story's
            non-historical nature.
            <br><br>
            However, the Book of Mormon faces a greater challenge. In the Book of Ether, the Tower of Babel is presented
            as a literal event:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            33 Which Jared came forth with his brother and their families, with some others and their families, from the
            great tower, at the time the Lord confounded the language of the people, and swore in his wrath that they
            should be scattered upon all the face of the earth; and according to the word of the Lord the people were
            scattered.
            <br><br>
            34 And the brother of Jared being a large and mighty man, and a man highly favored of the Lord, Jared, his
            brother, said unto him: Cry unto the Lord, that he will not confound us that we may not understand our
            words.
            <br><br>
            35 And it came to pass that the brother of Jared did cry unto the Lord, and the Lord had compassion upon
            Jared; therefore he did not confound the language of Jared; and Jared and his brother were not confounded.

            According to the Book of Mormon, if the Tower of Babel truly existed, then the story of Jared and his
            journey to the Americas with the unconfounded Adamic language must also be historically accurate. The entire
            narrative hinges on the reality of the Tower of Babel.
            <br><br>
            However, if the Tower of Babel is, as much evidence suggests, a mythical event, Jared’s story immediately
            loses its historical basis. This problem extends beyond just the Jaredite narrative. If the Tower of Babel
            did not actually occur, then the sixteen stones touched by the Lord in the Book of Ether are also
            non-historical. Consequently, the two stones sealed up with the plates of Jared, later used as Nephite
            interpreters, must also be fictional.
            <br><br>
            The issue becomes even more complicated when considering that these two stones—the Nephite interpreters—were
            buried with the gold plates of the Book of Mormon. If the Tower of Babel is mythical, as historical and
            linguistic evidence suggests, then the Nephite interpreters must also be mythical, since their existence
            depends on a literal Tower of Babel.
            <br><br>
            If the Nephite interpreters are mythical, this calls into question the entire foundation of the Book of
            Mormon. Moroni, according to the narrative, claimed to use these interpreters to translate the sealed plates
            containing the vision of "all things from the foundation of the world unto the end thereof" (2 Nephi 27:10),
            with the plates to be revealed “in mine own due time” (Ether 3:27). If the Tower of Babel is not historical,
            then Joseph Smith’s claim to have used the Nephite interpreters before switching to a seer stone becomes
            implausible. This suggests that the story of the stones could have been a creation of Joseph Smith, who was
            already familiar with the concept of using stones to see objects and messages from his treasure-digging
            activities.
            <br><br>
            The Book of Mormon’s reliance on a literal interpretation of the Bible, including stories like Adam and Eve
            and the global flood, contributes to the understanding that it cannot be a historical record. Even before
            examining other concerns about the church’s truth claims, whether through resources like the CES Letter or
            the Gospel Topics Essays, this dependence on biblical literalism poses a significant issue.
            <br><br>
            We know from historical and linguistic evidence that there was already a diversity of languages before the
            time the Tower of Babel was supposed to have occurred, and that these languages were not disrupted or lost
            following this event. Furthermore, many of the stories in Genesis, including the Tower of Babel, appear to
            draw heavily from older mythological sources. This suggests they were not intended to be understood as
            literal history, but as a way for ancient peoples to explain the world around them.
            <br><br>
            This presents a major problem for the Book of Mormon and Joseph Smith’s claims, as the text is built on the
            assumption that these mythological stories are grounded in literal history. If the foundation is not
            historical, then the stories that derive from it, including key elements of the Book of Mormon, cannot be
            historical either.

        <h2>Apologetic Response to the Tower of Babel Problems in the Book of Mormon</h2>

        <p>
            The Church teaches that the Tower of Babel is a literal, historical event, a belief that is essential due to
            the Book of Mormon's reliance on its historicity. This connection implies that if the Tower of Babel were
            not a real event, it could undermine the foundation of the Book of Mormon's historical claims. In a 1998
            Ensign article, BYU professor Donald W. Parry emphasized that “Because of the Prophet Joseph Smith,
            Latter-day Saints have additional knowledge that confirms the reality of these world-changing historical
            events.”
            <br><br>
            This article continues on with the following statement:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            For some in the modern world, the historicity of the tower of Babel story, as with the Flood, is often
            discounted. One modern school of thought considers the account to be nothing more than an “artful parable”
            and an “old tale.”<a class="note-ref"
                href="/study/ensign/1998/01/the-flood-and-the-tower-of-babel?lang=eng#note11"
                data-scroll-id="note11"><sup class="marker">11</sup></a> But Latter-day Saints accept the story as it is
            presented in Genesis. Further, we have the second witness of the Book of Mormon. The title page of the Book
            of Mormon explains that the book of Ether “is a record of the people of Jared, who were scattered at the
            time the Lord confounded the language of the people, when they were building a tower to get to heaven.” The
            book of Ether itself then tells of when “Jared came forth with his brother and their families, with some
            others and their families, <em>from the great tower,</em> at the time the Lord confounded the language of
            the people, and swore in his wrath that they should be scattered upon all the face of the earth” (<a

            There is surprisingly little apologetic work on the Tower of Babel and how it relates to the Book of Mormon,
            but we will highlight an article on FAIR Mormon that attempts to address these issues written by Michael
            Ash. (<a
                href="https://www.fairlatterdaysaints.org/answers/Question:_What%E2%80%99s_the_best_way_to_understand_the_Tower_of_Babel_scientifically%3F"

                    scientifically?</em></a>)
        </p>

        <p>Michael Ash admits in the introduction that:</p>

        <blockquote>
            “There are historical indicators, however, that suggest that the story is a myth in the scholarly sense.”
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Ash then goes on to present the possibility that the Book of Mormon is not actually citing the Tower of
            Babel with the following statement:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “When we shine the light of science and scholarship on the Tower of Babel, we find some interesting things.
            First, the word “Babel” comes from an Assyro-Babylonian word that means “Gate of God” and is related to a
            Hebrew word that means “confusion.” It appears that the author(s) of the Babel account are engaging in some
            word-play to make a particular point about the story. It’s also interesting to note that the book of Ether
            never mentions “Babel” but simply the “great tower.”
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            While I understand why Ash would want to give plausibility that the Book of Mormon is not referring to the
            Tower of Babel, it is an argument that simply cannot work. For example, look at the description of the Tower
            of Babel in the Bible compared to the Book of Mormon:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            And the Lord said, Behold, <strong>the people is one</strong>, and they have all one language; and this they
            begin to do: and
            now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.

            Go to, let us go down, and there <strong>confound their language, that they may not understand one another’s
                speech.</strong>

            So the Lord <strong>scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth</strong>: and they left
            off to build
            the city. (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/11?lang=eng"
                target="_blank">Genesis 11:6–8.</a><em> [emphasis added]</em>)
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            Which Jared came forth with his brother and their families, with some others and their families, from the
            great tower, at the time <strong>the Lord confounded the language of the people</strong>, and swore in his
            wrath that they
            should be <strong>scattered upon all the face of the earth</strong>; and according to the word of the Lord
            the people were
            scattered.

            And the brother of Jared being a large and mighty man, and a man highly favored of the Lord, Jared, his
            brother, said unto him: Cry unto the Lord, that he will not <strong>confound us that we may not
                understand</strong> our

        </blockquote>

        <p>
            The question of whether the Tower of Babel was a literal, historical event finds intriguing parallels in
            both the Bible and the Book of Mormon. Not only does the Book of Mormon employ similar language to that of
            the Bible, but the events described in both texts also seem to occur around the same time. Most
            significantly, Ether 2:1 explicitly states that the Jaredites “went down into the valley which was
            northward, (and the name of the valley was Nimrod, being called after the mighty hunter).”
            <br><br>
            Nimrod’s kingdom is traditionally associated with the construction of the Tower of Babel. As noted in Hebrew
            and Christian traditions, “in Hebrew and Christian tradition, Nimrod is considered the leader of those who
            built the Tower of Babel in the land of Shinar” (Menner, Robert J. (1938). "Nimrod and the Wolf in the Old
            English 'Solomon and Saturn'"). This
            aligns with the biblical narrative that links Nimrod to Babel’s construction.
            <br><br>
            Further supporting this connection, the heading of Ether chapter 1 in the Book of Mormon states: “Moroni
            abridges the writings of Ether—Ether’s genealogy is set forth—<strong> The language of the Jaredites is not
                confounded at the Tower of Babel</strong>—The Lord promises to lead them to a choice land and make them
            a great nation.”
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <p>
            The question of whether the Tower of Babel was a literal, historical event can be explored through various
            fields of study, all of which suggest that it was not. Linguistic evidence shows that the diversity of
            languages began long before the supposed time of the Tower of Babel, making it clear that the story is not
            grounded in historical fact. Additionally, Genesis 10 contradicts the idea of a single Adamic language,
            further casting doubt on the historicity of the Tower of Babel. The story itself appears to be influenced by
            other ancient myths that attempted to explain the origin of different languages.
            <br><br>
            This poses a challenge for religions that regard Genesis as sacred scripture. However, most are able to view
            the Tower of Babel as a myth and focus instead on the moral or spiritual lessons it offers. The difficulty
            arises with the Book of Mormon, which directly ties the Jaredite narrative to the Tower of Babel, making it
            impossible to reconcile the book’s historicity with the Tower of Babel being a myth.
            <br><br>
            According to the Book of Mormon, the Jaredites originated from the Tower of Babel and retained the original
            Adamic language after pleading with God. Their journey begins in the Valley of Nimrod, a reference to the
            Bible, and their story parallels the language and themes of Genesis.
            <br><br>
            The suggestion from some apologists that there might have been a second tower emerges from a need to
            maintain belief in the story's literal truth, despite overwhelming evidence that the Tower of Babel is not
            historical. This is part of a broader trend in religious apologetics, seen also with attempts to reinterpret
            the stories of Adam and Eve and the Great Flood, all of which face significant challenges from modern
            evidence. These shifts often stem from a position of weakness as the evidence no longer supports the
            church's foundational claims.
            <br><br>
            The Book of Mormon also claims that the Jaredite account comes from 24 plates, translated using Nephite
            interpreters that were touched by the Lord following the events at the Tower of Babel. Joseph Smith claimed
            these same interpreters were with the gold plates of the Book of Mormon. If the Tower of Babel is a myth, as
            the evidence indicates, then any story derived from it cannot be considered historical.

        <p>
            I understand that this process can be difficult and disillusioning, especially when questioning a faith you
            were raised in or converted to. However, if the church is true, there should be no fear in engaging with
            these materials. As Apostle James Talmage wisely stated:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “The man who cannot listen to an argument which opposes his views either has a weak position or is a weak
            defender of it. No opinion that cannot stand discussion or criticism is worth holding. And it has been
            wisely said that the man who knows only half of any question is worse off than the man who knows nothing of
            it. He is not only one sided, but his partisanship soon turns him into an intolerant and a fanatic. In
            general it is true that nothing which cannot stand up under discussion and criticism is worth defending.”
