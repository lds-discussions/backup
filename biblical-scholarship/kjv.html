        <h1>The King James Bible and the Book of Mormon</h1>

        <p>
            As we have outlined in our discussions on Adam and Eve, the global flood, and the Tower of Babel, the Book
            of Mormon—and Mormonism as a whole—depends on these Genesis stories being taken as literal, historical
            events. However, evidence from science, similar myths from other civilizations, and biblical scholarship
            indicates that these events were not actual historical occurrences.
            <br><br>
            The challenges for the Book of Mormon extend beyond the issues with Genesis, particularly when we examine
            its reliance on the King James Bible (KJV). At the time of the Book of Mormon’s translation, the King James
            Bible was the most accessible version, and Joseph Smith both owned it and was highly familiar with its
            content.
            <br><br>
            However, the King James Bible was written in 1611, long after the purported events described in the Book of
            Mormon. This creates significant problems, especially when we consider that the Book of Mormon incorporates
            material from the KJV, including mistranslations.
            <br><br>
            This issue also raises questions about the method by which Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon. As an
            investigator in the 1990s, I was told that Smith read the translation directly from the gold plates, using
            an instrument known as the Urim and Thummim.
            <br><br>
            However, according to the church's official Gospel Topics essay, Smith actually translated the Book of
            Mormon by placing a stone (previously used for treasure digging) into a hat and reading words that appeared
            on it (<a href="/backup/book-of-mormon/essay-translation.html" target="_blank"><em>LDS Expanded Essay -
                    Translation</em></a>). These words were then written by his scribe and only disappeared once they
            were recorded correctly.
            <br><br>
            In other words, if the words appeared through divine revelation, the Book of Mormon should not contain any
            errors or language unknown to the people described in the text. Furthermore, if errors or 19th-century
            influences are present, it strengthens the argument that Joseph Smith was the author of the Book of Mormon.
        </p>

        <h2>Problems with the Book of Mormon's Use of the King James Bible</h2>

        <p>
            The inclusion of language from the King James Bible presents numerous challenges for the Book of Mormon.
            Here, we will highlight a few key issues and provide additional resources for further study.
        </p>

        <h3>Mistranslations</h3>

        <p>
            The Book of Mormon includes language directly from the King James Bible that is now recognized as
            mistranslated from the original texts. This poses a significant problem, as the Book of Mormon is described
            as “the most correct book on Earth” and a direct translation from the gold plates. How, then, could it
            contain language from 1611, including errors from the King James translation?
            <br><br>
            In the following examples, we will refer to a detailed analysis of the issues raised by the King James Bible
            in relation to the Book of Mormon, specifically regarding the Book of Mormon's dependence on the KJV (<a
                href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mormon/comments/e5lhqd/the_book_of_mormons_dependence_on_the_kjv_an/"
                target="_blank"><em>The Book of Mormon's dependence on the KJV - an exhausting effort-post</em></a>).

        <p>
            From the write-up:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            One of the reasons I like this example is because it's a twofer. In the same verse, we have the Book of
            Mormon preserving a KJV mistranslation, while introducing a new redaction. It's difficult to argue that God
            is simply transmitting the KJV to Joseph, errors and all, when in the very same verse Joseph makes another
            incorrect redaction. (For discussion of why the added phrase is incorrect, see <a
                href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mormon/comments/bpupw6/comment/enxqnzz/" target="_blank">this
                discussion</a> which has
            some overlap, and this <a
                href="https://publications.mi.byu.edu/publications/jbms/14/2/S00005-50c257241c7d12Pike:Seely.pdf">BYU
                paper</a> which has a similar conclusion). Another reason I like it is because the
            source of the mistranslation is clear (the KJV translators didn't have access to the Egyptian loan-word).
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            There is another great project that highlights some other verses where mistranslations found their way
            directly into the Book of Mormon from the King James Bible, where the author contacted biblical scholars and
            asked them to address which translations were inaccurate by ranking the seriousness of the errors. (<a
                href="https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/scholar-survey-kjv-translation-errors-in-bom-isaiah/"
                target="_blank"><em>Scholar Survey: King James Version translation errors in Book of Mormon Isaiah
                    passages</em></a>)
            <br><br>
            Again, these are errors that should not be in the Book of Mormon given that it is supposed to have been
            translated directly from the gold plates without any outside sources. So either the author of the Book of
            Mormon had access to a Bible translation that was not written until 1611, or Joseph Smith was using the King
            James Bible while composing the Book of Mormon.
        </p>

        <h3>Italicized Words and Phrases</h3>

        <p>
            The KJV was a translation of the Bible, taking the original text and trying to make it more readable in
            modern day English. In order to accomplish this, the translators would insert words in italics that were not
            a part of the original translation, but necessary so that the text flowed naturally for the readers.
            <br><br>
            Both the use and purpose of italics in the KJV was known during Joseph Smith’s time, and W.W. Phelps cited
            this in the Evening and Morning Star:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “As to the errors in the bible, any man possessed of common understanding, knows, that both the old and new
            testaments are filled with <strong>errors, obscurities, italics and contradictions</strong>, which must be
            the work of men.”
            (“Errors of the Bible,” The Evening and the Morning Star 2, no. 14 (July 1833): 106.)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            W.W. Phelps made the case a few months earlier that the Book of Mormon does not use italics as a crutch as
            the King James Bible, which was translated by man and not God, often does:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “The book of Mormon, as a revelation from God, possesses some advantage over the old scripture: it has not
            been tinctured by the wisdom of man, <strong>with here and there an Italic word to supply
                deficiencies.</strong>” (“The Book of Mormon,” The Evening and the Morning Star 1, no. 8 (January 1833):
            58.)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            But what is fascinating is that as Joseph Smith incorporated parts of Isaiah into the Book of Mormon, he was
            much more focused on changing the italics than the rest of the text. Biblical scholar David Wright has
            written extensively on <a href="https://user.xmission.com/~research/central/isabm1.html"
                target="_blank">Joseph Smith’s use of the KJV chapters of Isaiah in the Book of Mormon</a>, and this is
            a
            great summary of the problem from the above write-up:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            Depending on how conservatively you judge them, between 22-38% of all differences between the Book of Mormon
            and KJV Isaiah text are associated with words italicized in the KJV (Wright, pg 161). Skousen (a
            confessional scholar) calculates it at 29%. Only 3.6% of the words in the relevant KJV passages are
            italicized, so the correlation is significant. Furthermore, 40% of words italicized in the KJV are missing
            in their corresponding Book of Mormon passages. Of the other 60%, many passages had environmental changes
            related to those italics. The Book of Mormon seems to be particularly concerned with KJV italics, which
            suggests that it's derivative of the English KJV text rather than an ancient common ancestor. These
            revisions often cause problems: for example, Isaiah 51:19 reads "These two things are come unto thee." The
            Book of Mormon changes the italicized word things to sons. This revision doesn't work in Hebrew since the
            phrase is formulated in the feminine, whereas the word "sons" is masculine. There are many more similar
            examples you can read in Wright's essay. (<a
                href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mormon/comments/e5lhqd/the_book_of_mormons_dependence_on_the_kjv_an/"
                target="_blank"><em>The Book of Mormon's dependence on the KJV - an exhausting effort-post</em></a>).
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Put another way, Joseph Smith is aware of the problems that the italicized words create in the KJV to the
            point where he’s uniquely focused on them as he copies those chapters and passages into the Book of Mormon.
            This should not even be an issue given that the method of translation is that Joseph Smith read the words
            directly off his “seer stone” that was placed in his hat, just as he claimed to do when searching for buried
            treasure. In other words, if Joseph Smith is reading words off of the stone in a hat as the scribes of the
            Book of Mormon claimed, then why are words from the KJV being pulled in at all – italicized or not?
            <br><br>
            There is no better way to illustrate how Joseph Smith began with the KJV text of Isaiah and then revised it
            as he saw fit, typically focusing on the italics as noted above. From Stan Larson:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “In 1 Nephi 20:11 the words of Isaiah 48:11 “how should my name be polluted” (notice the two words that are
            italicized in the KJV) were revised initially to “how should I suffer my [na]me to be polluted,” then the
            KJV words “how should” and the Book of Mormon “I” were crossed out and a supra-linear revision gave the
            final Book of Mormon declaration “I will not suffer my name to be polluted.” This revision shows that for a
            biblical quotation in the Book of Mormon, Joseph Smith used the English KJV as a base text for the revision
            later embodied in the Book of Mormon.” (<a
                href="https://archivespace.lib.utah.edu/repositories/3/archival_objects/154900" target="_blank">Stan
                Larson. 1986. <em>The Sermon on the Mount: What Its Textual Translation Discloses Concerning the
                    Historicity of the Book of Mormon</em></a>)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Again, this does not match in any possible way with the KJV text being on the gold plates or with the words
            appearing on Joseph Smith’s stone in his hat. This shows that Joseph Smith was pulling portions of the KJV
            into the Book of Mormon as he produced it, and then made alterations to the text just as he would do in his
            translation of the Bible following the completion of the Book of Mormon.

        <h3>Use of the New Testament in the Book of Mormon
        </h3>

        <p>
            Let’s be clear from the outset: Any use of New Testament phrasing from the King James Version (KJV) in the
            Book of Mormon is anachronistic. The Book of Mormon writers, living in the Americas before Jesus’ time,
            could not have had access to the New Testament. The claim from some apologists that these passages were
            revealed by divine means is even more problematic, given that the language used comes from the KJV, which
            wasn’t written until 1611.
            <br><br>
            While there are several related topics we will explore in more detail later, I want to briefly address a few
            key points here, as they present significant challenges to the authenticity of the Book of Mormon beyond the
            use of KJV as a source text.
            <br><br>
            In addition to borrowing language from the KJV, the Book of Mormon also incorporates wording that was added
            to the New Testament long after the original texts were written. Consider the following example from Stan
            Larson’s essay:
        </p>

        <table border="1" cellpadding="10" style="width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse;">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Matthew 5:27 (NRSV)</th>
                    <th>Matthew 5:27 (KJV)</th>
                    <th>3 Nephi 12:27</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>You have heard that it was said, “You shall not commit adultery.”</td>
                    <td>You have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery:</td>
                    <td>Behold, it is written by them of old time, that thou shalt not commit adultery;
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>
            The phrase “by them of old time” was a late addition to the text of Matthew, which is a problem by itself,
            but compounding this problem is that it was also a mistranslation of the later manuscripts that included
            this addition (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-27.htm" target="_blank">Bible Hub. <em>Matthew
                    5:27</em></a>). Instead of “by them of old time,” it would read “unto [or “to”] them of old time.”
            <br><br>
            When you look at the Book of Mormon, the writer includes not just the late addition of “unto them of old
            time,” but the mistranslation from the KJV which says “by them of old time.” If Jesus was truly speaking the
            same words to the Americas as he did during his lifetime as many apologists argue in order to provide
            plausibility, why is Jesus speaking to the Book of Mormon people in words that were not in the original
            texts as well as the improper translation of those words?
            <br><br>
            These problems with using late additions are not just isolated to one passage. In the use of Isaiah in the
            Book of Mormon, the writer of the Book of Mormon includes the later addition of “Deutero-Isaiah” which was
            not written until after Lehi left Jerusalem, and even includes references to what is known as “Trito-Isaiah”
            in 2 Nephi 9:14, written even later.
            <br><br>
            Furthermore, the ending of Mark in the Bible has a later addition known as the “long ending of Mark.” We
            will cover this in more depth in an upcoming section, but the original manuscripts of Mark end at 16:8:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “So they went out quickly and fled from the tomb, for they trembled and were amazed. And they said nothing
            to anyone, for they were afraid.” (Mark 16:8)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Mark 16:9-20 was a later addition that most scholars believe was attached as the ‘original ending’ of Mark
            felt very unsatisfying to readers. This should not be a problem for the Book of Mormon as none of this
            material would have been available to the Book of Mormon people, but the Book of Mormon actually quotes
            directly from these additional verses from Mark 16:15-18:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            15 And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.
            <br>
            16 He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.
            <br>
            17 And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak
            with new tongues;
            <br>
            18 They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay
            hands on the sick, and they shall recover.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Compare to Mormon 9:22-24
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “For behold, thus said Jesus Christ, the Son of God… Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to
            every creature; And he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, but he that believeth not shall be
            damned; And these signs shall follow them that believe—in my name shall they cast out devils; they shall
            speak with new tongues; they shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt
            them; they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover.”
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Again, please keep in mind that any New Testament text from the King James Bible is already anachronistic,
            but in this case it becomes even more problematic as the longer ending was not even in the original text and
            was thus highly unlikely to be authentic to Jesus’ teachings.
            <br><br>
            There are some biblical scholars that believe that the “long ending of Mark” is authentic and was merely
            lost from the earliest manuscripts, and we will cover that in an upcoming section in more detail, but even
            if there was another ending that had been lost, it would never have been worded as it appears in the King
            James Bible, which is a very difficult problem for the authenticity of the Book of Mormon as ancient
            history.
        </p>

        <h3>The Sermon on the Mount and the Sermon at the Temple</h3>

        <p>
            In the Book of Mormon, when Jesus visits the Americas, there is arguably a pivotal moment where He delivers
            what is referred to as the “Sermon at the Temple” in 3 Nephi. This sermon closely mirrors Matthew’s “Sermon
            on the Mount,” rather than Luke’s “Sermon on the Plain,” which is significant when analyzing its reliance on
            the King James Bible (KJV).
            <br><br>
            While we will explore the “Sermon on the Mount” in greater detail in a future post, for the purposes of this
            section, we aim to demonstrate how the text signals that the Book of Mormon is a 19th-century work that
            draws directly from the KJV as a source.
            <br><br>
            One of the simplest ways to show the Book of Mormon’s dependence on the KJV is to examine the changes made
            in the text, as well as those left unchanged.
            <br><br>
            For example, in Matthew 5:26, the KJV includes the phrase “thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.”
            Recognizing that a "farthing" was British currency and irrelevant to an ancient American audience, the Book
            of Mormon substitutes it with “senine,” a Nephite coin mentioned in Alma (a book written just two before 3
            Nephi) but never referenced again after this one mention (3 Nephi 12:26).
            <br><br>
            However, not all such culturally specific references were adapted. In Matthew 5:41 (KJV), Jesus refers to a
            Roman law:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            "And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain."
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This refers to a Roman practice where:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            Roman soldiers could grab any Jewish citizen they chose and force that person to carry luggage or other
            items for a standard mile. That kind of oppressive, invasive act would naturally inspire a hunger for
            revenge. Culturally, it would entice people to violently overthrow the Romans.(<a
                href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/5/Matthew-5-41.html" target="_blank">Bible Ref <em>What does
                    Matthew 5:41 mean?</em></a>)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Jesus’ teaching, in this context, encourages going the extra mile rather than seeking revenge.
        </p>

        <p>
            However in the Book of Mormon it is used in 3 Nephi 12:41 <strong>exactly</strong> as in the KJV
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.”
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This reference to Roman law would have been meaningless to people in the ancient Americas, as it pertains to
            a specific Roman custom. While the farthing reference was easy to recognize and modify due to its obvious
            anachronism, this Roman law was not as clear-cut, implying that the writer may have been unaware of its
            historical background.
            <br><br>
            As with previous examples, this demonstrates how the writer of the Book of Mormon began with the KJV text,
            making selective revisions to better integrate it into the Book of Mormon narrative.
            <br><br>
            A final example from the Sermon at the Temple is that the Book of Mormon retains the word “raca:”
        </p>

        <table border="1" cellpadding="10" style="width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse;">
            <thead>
                <tr>

                    <th>Matthew 5:22</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger
                        of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the
                        council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.</td>
                    <td>But I say unto you, that whosoever is angry with his brother shall be in danger of his judgment.
                        And whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council; and whosoever
                        shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>
            Again, using New Testament language is anachronistic because it would not have been known or available to
            Book of Mormon people, but <em>was</em> available in the 19th century to someone writing the Book of Mormon
            under the
            premise of translating an ancient record. But more importantly, the word Raca is Aramaic, which is what
            Jesus spoke in his lifetime, but not what anyone in the Americas would understand. It would make no sense
            for Jesus to use a word like Raca to an audience who could not possibly understand what it means as it's a
            completely different language.
            <br><br>
            In other words, even if we are to believe the apologetic argument that Jesus was merely repeating his exact
            Sermon on the Mount (from the Matthean tradition) similar to how politicians repeat stump speeches during a
            campaign, which is highly problematic from a historical standpoint, we would then need to believe that Jesus
            changed one term that would mean nothing to the people of the Americas (farthing), yet neglected to
            change/remove references to a Roman practice or an insult in Aramaic that they would not have known or
            spoke.
            <br><br>
            Yet these are the <em>exact</em> kinds of errors you would expect from a 19th century writer who is using
            the KJV to
            create their story, and would remove the obvious error of farthing yet leave in the Roman practice and
            Aramaic word because those problems would not haven been widely known in his worldview.
        </p>

        <h3>Other Errors From the King James Bible</h3>

        <p>
            In addition to problems with mistranslations, italics, New Testament phrasing, and the Sermon on the Mount,
            there are other problems that arise from using the KJV as the foundation for much of the text in the Book of
            Mormon.
            <br><br>
            In the write-up we cited at the beginning of this section, there are other crucial examples of where the
            writer of the Book of Mormon brings it words from the KJV that hold a different meaning in the way they are
            used. A good example of this is from 2 Nephi:
        </p>

        <table border="1" cellpadding="10" style="width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse;">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th> Isaiah 5:4 (KJV) </th>
                    <th> 2 Nephi 15:4 </th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>Wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?</td>
                    <td>Wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes it brought forth wild grapes.</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>
            From the write-up:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            The distinction is subtle, but important. "Wherefore" in the KJV version is an interrogation - it means
            "why?" The NRSV translates it: "When I expected it to yield grapes, why did it yield wild grapes?" The Book
            of Mormon turns it into a conjunction instead. "Wherefore" carries this dual meaning in English, but not in
            Hebrew.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Again, these are all issues that make it clear to biblical scholars that the Book of Mormon is a 19th
            century work that is simply not historical.
        </p>

        <h3>Apologetic Response to the King James Bible Problems</h3>

        <p>
            We covered a large range of issues in this section, but I still want to cover the overall use of the KJV in
            the Book of Mormon from an apologetic perspective.
            <br><br>
            From the <a
                href="https://www.fairlatterdaysaints.org/answers/Detailed_response_to_CES_Letter,_Book_of_Mormon#Response_to_claim:_.22What_are_these_17th_century_italicized_words_doing_in_the_Book_of_Mormon.3F.22"
                target="_blank"><em>FAIR Mormon response to the CES Letter on the use of the KJV</em></a>:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            The Book of Mormon incorporates text which seems to be taken from the Bible, including passages which are
            now considered to be mistranslations in the King James Version… We do not know the specific mechanism by
            which the biblical passages were included in the translation, therefore we cannot answer this question
            definitively based upon current historical information. The only description of the translation process that
            Joseph Smith ever gave was that it was performed by the "gift and power of God," and that the translation
            was performed using the "Urim and Thummim.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            It is important to note that these mistranslations are not disputed, and that the Book of Mormon should not
            include mistranslations from a Bible that was created in 1611. FAIR acknowledges the mistranslations in this
            statement, which is important. More from FAIR:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “Witnesses to the translation process never reported that a Bible or any other book was present during the
            translation. Given this evidence, we could assume that the Biblical passages were revealed to Joseph during
            the translation process in a format almost identical with similar passages in the King James Bible. Joseph
            performed most of the translation in the open using the stone and the hat. Thus how do we get the language
            from the King James version of the Bible?”
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This is not an answer, but a deflection. By the very premise, we could assume <em>anything</em> we want,
            because
            there really is not much information that we know beyond Joseph Smith using the same stone he searched for
            buried treasure with to translate the Book of Mormon in a hat.
            <br><br>
            If you want to take the approach that God revealed to Joseph Smith incorrect text from the Book of Mormon,
            it really opens up a lot of other issues. For example, if the Book of Mormon is a revelation from God, why
            did they need to make changes to it as Joseph Smith’s theology on the godhead evolved? Did God really choose
            the phrase “white and delightsome” via revelation on the stone in a hat only to have it changed later to
            “pure and delightsome” once the racism of that theology was noted?
            <br><br>
            Put another way, this is the apologetic way of saying “we can’t know everything,” so throw out everything we
            do know. If we look at the evidence above, it is clear that the writer of the Book of Mormon began with the
            KJV and then edited the passages to fit into the Book of Mormon. We don’t need to make assumptions if we
            look at the evidence, and that is where apologetics tries to steer us away from what we do know to what we
            don’t know. More from FAIR:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “When considering the the data, Skousen proposes that, instead of Joseph or Oliver looking at a Bible, that
            God was simply able to provide the page of text from the King James Bible to Joseph's mind and then Joseph
            was free to alter the text as he pleased. In those cases where the Book of Mormon simply alludes to or
            echoes KJV language, perhaps the Lord allowed these portions of the text to be revealed in such a way that
            they would be more comprehensible/comfortable to his 19th century, Northeastern, frontier audience.”
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Again, this implies a <a href="/backup/book-of-mormon/tight-loose.html" target="_blank">loose
                translation</a> where Joseph
            Smith is allowed to edit the text as he sees fit. This
            does not fit with the witnesses who claim that Joseph Smith read words off the stone in a hat, and that the
            words did not change until they were recorded exactly as they appeared. Consider these two statements from
            David Whitmer and Martin Harris – two of the three witnesses:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            David Whitmer wrote the following about the translation: “Joseph Smith would put the seer stone into a hat,
            and put his face in the hat, drawing it closely around his face to exclude the light; and in the darkness
            the spiritual light would shine. A piece of something resembling parchment would appear, and on that
            appeared the writing. One character at a time would appear, and under it was the interpretation in English.
            Brother Joseph would read off the English to Oliver Cowdery, who was his principal scribe, and <strong>when
                it was
                written down and repeated to Brother Joseph to see if it was correct, then it would disappear, and
                another
                character with the interpretation would appear.</strong>" (David Whitmer, An Address to All Believers in
            Christ,
            Richmond, Mo.: n.p., 1887, p. 12.)
            <br><br>
            Martin Harris described the translation process to Edward Stevenson, a member of the LDS First Council of
            Seventy: "Martin Harris related an incident that occurred during the time that he wrote that portion of the
            translation of the Book of Mormon which he was favored to write direct from the mouth of the Prophet Joseph
            Smith. He said that the Prophet possessed a seer stone, by which he was enabled to translate as well as from
            the Urim and Thummim, and for convenience he then used the seer stone, Martin explained the translation as
            follows: By aid of the seer stone, sentences would appear and were read by the Prophet and written by Martin
            and when finished he would say "Written,"<strong>and if correctly written that sentence would disappear and
                another
                appear in its place, but if not written correctly it remained until corrected, so that the translation
                was
                just as it was engraven on the plates, precisely in the language then used.</strong>" ("One of the Three
            Witnesses,"

        <p>
            The point is that these accounts are impossible to reconcile with Skousen’s idea that Joseph Smith had the
            King James Bible pages appear to him in the hat with the ability to alter them as he saw fit. If that were
            the case, either Whitmer or Harris would have made some note of that, but instead both are clear that the
            words did not change until they were written down exactly as they appeared. Martin Harris even implies that
            the reason the text preserved the "language then used," which we now know is not possible since the language
            of the Book of Mormon is a 19th century fronteir language blended with the King James Bible.
            <br><br>
            This is another instance where Occam’s Razor comes in, which tells us that the most obvious answer is that
            Joseph Smith was using the KJV as the foundation for much of the Book of Mormon because Joseph himself wrote
            the Book of Mormon and was using ideas familiar to him, and not that God commanded a record to be preserved
            for thousands of years only to allow Joseph Smith change it as he saw fit, using a Bible translation that is
            riddled with errors and problems.

            We won’t highlight every one of FAIR’s rebuttals as this section is already getting long, but you can read
            their entire response on their site (<a
                href="https://www.fairlatterdaysaints.org/answers/Detailed_response_to_CES_Letter,_Book_of_Mormon#Response_to_claim:_.22What_are_these_17th_century_italicized_words_doing_in_the_Book_of_Mormon.3F.22"
                target="_blank">Fair. <em>Detailed response to CES Letter, Book of Mormon</em></a>). I do want to
            highlight two more points they make because I think they
            are important for this topic.
            <br><br>
            First is a quote from Richard Lloyd Anderson in the September 1977 issue of Ensign:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “Summarizing the view taken by Latter-day Saint scholars on this point, Daniel H. Ludlow emphasizes the
            inherent variety of independent translation and concludes: “There appears to be only one answer to explain
            the word-for-word similarities between the verses of Isaiah in the Bible and the same verses in the Book of
            Mormon.” That is simply that Joseph Smith must have opened Isaiah and tested each mentioned verse by the
            Spirit: “<strong>If his translation was essentially the same as that of the King James version, he
                apparently quoted
                the verse from the Bible.</strong>” <sup>[4]</sup> Thus the Old Testament passages from Isaiah display a
            particular choice of
            phraseology that suggests Joseph Smith’s general freedom throughout the Book of Mormon for optional
            wording.”
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This quote is making an apologetic version of the same case that scholars make, which is that there is no
            other explanation besides Joseph Smith using the King James Bible during the production of the Book of
            Mormon. Clearly Joseph Smith was consulting the King James Bible as the text is identical in many areas and
            would not match any other Bible translation in the same way.
            <br><br>
            As we explained above, it’s pretty clear that Joseph Smith was changing the text of the KJV as he produced
            the text into the Book of Mormon, paying special attention to the italicized words that scholars at the time
            knew were additions to help the text read more smoothly to modern readers. Stan Larson’s explanation above
            as to how Joseph Smith began with the KJV wording and then made changes from there on the original
            manuscript is inescapable proof of this process.
            <br><br>
            In other words, Ludlow’s assertion here is that the evidence is too overwhelming to deny that Joseph Smith
            used the King James Bible during the production, but his apologetic spin is that God allowed him to copy
            directly from the KJV instead of simply dictating what appeared on the stone in a hat. It’s a really
            specious argument and goes against all common sense when you look at what the witness accounts of Whitmer
            and Harris said about the translation process. If Joseph was reading directly off the stone, why would he
            set the hat and stone down to copy from the King James Bible, which was an imperfect text? This is a problem
            with no good answers for the church's truth claims.
            <br><br>
            One final note I want to highlight from FAIR’s response is about the problems with the King James Bible
            errors appearing in the Book of Mormon when we now know that earlier manuscripts of the Bible do not contain
            such errors. From FAIR:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “It is not the case that the Great Isaiah Scroll (1QIsa[a]) is the original text of Isaiah. It is an earlier
            witness to the text than we previously had before the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls (DSS), but it itself
            is centuries removed from the original(s).”
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This argument is a deflection that attempts to keep members from thinking about the problem at hand. There
            are almost certainly earlier manuscripts before the Dead Sea Scrolls, but the idea that the earlier scrolls
            contain the King James Bible errors is so ridiculous that it would only ever be made out of necessity in an
            attempt to give plausibility to the problems that Joseph Smith created by copying KJV language into the Book
            of Mormon.
            <br><br>
            FAIR is effectively again saying “we can’t know everything” here, and implying that earlier manuscripts
            might revert back to the errors that came with the King James Bible. It is stunning that they would make
            this argument, but it is made by muddying the waters with the idea that scribes made copies of copies and we
            can’t possibly know which one is the authentic text, which is the point they outline here:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “Even the Book of Mormon text would have been far removed from Isaiah. The brass plates version would have
            been at least a century after the fact (with many copies intervening), and that was copied and recopied into
            Book of Mormon records, which was translated not in a scholarly fashion but instead by the gift and power of
            God through Joseph Smith. Therefore, it is a fallacy to assume that the Book of Mormon text ought to be the
            exact equivalent to the original text.”
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Again, this argument is nonsensical because we know that Joseph Smith included text from the King James
            Bible, written in 1611, in the Book of Mormon. No one is saying that the Book of Mormon should match the
            original text, because no one can say definitively what the original text looks like. What we’re saying,
            however, is that the Book of Mormon, claimed to have been written thousands of years earlier, should
            <strong>not</strong> match a translation written in 1611 that just happened to be in Joseph Smith’s
            possession when he produced the Book of Mormon.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <p>
            In the previous sections, we examined how the Book of Mormon relies on events from Genesis as literal,
            historical facts. This presents a significant issue, as modern understanding has shown that these events
            cannot be considered historical.
            <br><br>
            The frequent use of these accounts throughout the Book of Mormon clearly indicates that the Bible served as
            a source for the text. Moreover, the extensive incorporation of the King James Bible—a translation not
            completed until 1611—further underscores that this version of the Bible was foundational to the Book of
            Mormon.
            <br><br>
            As outlined earlier, the Book of Mormon not only contains passages from the King James Bible (which is
            anachronistic in itself) but also includes mistranslations, late additions, and quotes from Jesus that would
            be contextually irrelevant to the ancient Americas.
            <br><br>
            The Book of Mormon’s dependence on the stories of Genesis as literal events demonstrates that it is not a
            historical document. Furthermore, its heavy reliance on the King James Bible strongly suggests that it is
            not an ancient work, but rather a 19th-century creation by someone familiar with the King James text. This
            view is encapsulated by church historian Richard Bushman, who summarizes the issues with the Book of Mormon
            as follows:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “And then there is the fact that there is phrasing everywhere–long phrases that if you google them you will
            find them in 19th century writings. The theology of the Book of Mormon is very much 19th century theology,
            and it reads like a 19th century understanding of the Hebrew Bible as an Old Testament. That is, it has
            Christ in it the way Protestants saw Christ everywhere in the Old Testament. That’s why we now call it
            “Hebrew Bible” because the Jews never saw it quite that way. So, these are all problems we have to deal
            with.” (<a href="https://mormondiscussionpodcast.org/2017/05/premium-book-mormon-historicity/"

        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This issue cannot be easily dismissed. As we continue to examine not only the authenticity of the Book of
            Mormon but also Joseph Smith’s other works, such as the Book of Moses and the Book of Abraham, it becomes
            increasingly evident that these are 19th-century writings. They use the King James Bible as a foundation to
            lend authority to the theological ideas that Joseph Smith was developing.
        </p>

        <!--call to reflection-->
        <p>
            I understand that this process can be difficult and disillusioning, especially when questioning a faith you
            were raised in or converted to. However, if the church is true, there should be no fear in engaging with
            these materials. As Apostle James Talmage wisely stated:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “The man who cannot listen to an argument which opposes his views either has a weak position or is a weak
            defender of it. No opinion that cannot stand discussion or criticism is worth holding. And it has been
            wisely said that the man who knows only half of any question is worse off than the man who knows nothing of
            it. He is not only one sided, but his partisanship soon turns him into an intolerant and a fanatic. In
            general it is true that nothing which cannot stand up under discussion and criticism is worth defending.”

            I couldn’t agree more, and I hope members will approach these
            pages with an open heart and mind.
