        <h1>The Global Flood and the Scriptures of Mormonism</h1>

        <p>
            The global flood is a well-known story from Genesis, in which Noah builds an ark to survive a catastrophic
            deluge that destroys “all flesh [that] died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of
            beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man” (Genesis 7:21).
            <br><br>
            This story holds even greater significance in the scriptures of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
            Saints. The historicity of Noah’s flood is central to the premise of the Book of Mormon and Book of Abraham,
            and it is both confirmed and expanded upon in the Book of Moses.
            <br><br>
            However, the concept of a global flood is part of a broader mythological tradition found across ancient
            cultures. Noah’s story in Genesis mirrors the Babylonian myth The Epic of Gilgamesh in several key aspects.
            Moreover, advancements in science, archaeology, and history provide substantial evidence that there was no
            global flood that wiped out all humans and animals or disrupted existing civilizations.
        </p>

        <h2>Problems with a Global Flood</h2>

        <p>
            There are hundreds of flood myths from cultures around the world, suggesting that ancient civilizations
            created these stories to explain catastrophic local floods, much like the ones we experience today. A glance
            at Wikipedia reveals a range of notable flood myths across different cultures.
            <br><br>
            One of the most famous is the Epic of Gilgamesh, a story that appears to have inspired the biblical tale of
            Noah’s flood. The “Old Babylonian” version of Gilgamesh was written around 1800 BCE. As discussed in the
            Adam and Eve section, most scholars agree that Genesis was compiled in the 6th or 5th century BCE, with the
            earliest possible date being around 1000 BCE.
            <br><br>
            The Epic of Gilgamesh contains many parallels to the Bible, particularly the global flood myth. There are
            also notable similarities between the Epic and the Adam and Eve story. For instance, in the tale of Enkidu
            and Shamhat: “In both, a man is created from the soil by a god and lives among animals in a natural setting.
            A woman tempts him, he accepts food, covers his nakedness, and is forced to leave his former realm, unable
            to return. A snake later steals a plant of immortality, echoing the biblical serpent.” (<a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_of_Gilgamesh#Relationship_to_the_Bible" target="_blank">Epic of
                Gilgamesh
                Similarities to the Bible</a>)
            <br><br>
            The parallels between the global flood stories in Gilgamesh and Genesis are equally striking. Babylonian
            scholar Andrew George, in his translation of Gilgamesh, noted that the Genesis flood account is so similar
            to Gilgamesh that “few doubt” the Genesis version was derived from it (George, A. R. (2003). The Babylonian
            Gilgamesh Epic: Introduction, Critical Edition, and Cuneiform Texts, p. 70).
            <br><br>
            In the Epic of Gilgamesh, the gods secretly plan to flood the world. However, the god Ea (known as Enki in
            Sumerian mythology) warns Utnapishtim, instructing him to demolish his house and build a boat to preserve
            both people and animals. The boat, constructed with six decks divided into seven and nine compartments, was
            loaded with Utnapishtim’s relatives, craftsmen, and "all the beasts and animals of the field.”
            <br><br>
            The flood lasts six days and nights, and the boat finally rests on Mount Nimush. Utnapishtim sends a dove
            and then a raven to check if the waters have receded. Afterward, he releases the animals to repopulate the
            earth and offers sacrifices to the gods (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgamesh_flood_myth"
                target="_blank">Overview of Epic of Gilgamesh flood story</a>).
            <br><br>
            While Noah’s story in Genesis differs in certain details, the similarities are too significant to ignore. In
            both, a man is instructed by a god to build a ship to survive a flood that will cleanse the Earth of living
            beings. In both stories, the boat lands on a mountain, and birds are sent to determine if the waters have
            receded. Both accounts end with sacrifices made in gratitude for survival.
            <br><br>
            Some argue that the Noah and Gilgamesh stories share a common origin, but either way, it’s clear these tales
            are derived from myth rather than history. Flood myths are widespread across different civilizations, but
            many stories in Genesis, particularly the flood narrative, are rooted in Babylonian myths that would have
            been familiar to those compiling Genesis long after Gilgamesh was written.
            <br><br>
            From a scientific perspective, overwhelming evidence contradicts the occurrence of a global flood, which we
            will briefly discuss. The consensus among scholars and scientists is that such an event did not happen. Even
            FAIR Mormon acknowledges that the global flood story “appears to be at complete odds with scientific data.”
            While we will address some apologetic arguments below, it is important to recognize that this is not a
            controversial issue—the overwhelming consensus is that no global flood occurred.
            <br><br>
            Several websites detail the reasons why a global flood is implausible, and we will summarize the key points
            here. Links will be provided for those who wish to explore further, as the evidence overwhelmingly supports
            the conclusion that the global flood story is not historical.
            <br><br>
            First, the logistics of Noah's Ark are simply impossible. A wooden ship, 450 feet long, would not survive a
            flood without significant reinforcements—none of which were available in Noah’s time. Second, gathering two
            of every animal (or seven of each pure species, according to the second flood account in Genesis) would be
            impossible, considering how scattered animals are across continents.
            <br><br>
            Imagine trying to fit two of each species on a ship, managing to prevent them from attacking one another.
            These are clear elements of a mythical story.
            <br><br>
            Even if we assume Noah succeeded in gathering two (or seven) of every animal and somehow managed to fit them
            all on the ark without conflict, there are still insurmountable logistical problems. Let's break it down:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Food Requirements:</strong>
                <p>
                    The amount of food needed to feed every species would be overwhelming. Each species has different
                    dietary needs. For instance, carnivores require fresh meat, while herbivores need large quantities
                    of specific plants. Storing such a variety of food for a prolonged period on a ship would be
                    impossible.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Water Needs:</strong>
                <p>
                    Different species also have varying water requirements. For example, large mammals like elephants
                    need hundreds of liters of water daily, while smaller animals like birds require far less. Providing
                    enough water for all these animals for an extended period on the ark would require an immense and
                    impractical supply.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Exercise and Space:</strong>
                <p>
                    Many animals need exercise and space to maintain their health. For instance, large mammals like
                    horses need room to move, while birds need space to fly. Caging them in a confined space for the
                    duration of the flood would result in severe health problems.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Sanitation:</strong>
                <p>
                    Managing waste on the ark would be another impossible challenge. Thousands of animals would generate
                    massive amounts of waste daily. Without proper sanitation, diseases would quickly spread,
                    endangering the lives of both the animals and Noah’s family.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Environmental Needs:</strong>
                <p>
                    Different animals require specific climates to survive. Polar animals, like penguins or polar bears,
                    need cold conditions, while tropical species, like snakes, require warmth. Maintaining appropriate
                    environments for such a diverse range of species on a single ship would be impossible.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Even if these practical problems could be solved, the scientific issues surrounding a global flood remain
            (<a href="https://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-noahs-ark.html" target="_blank">Mark Isaak. <em>Problems with
                    a Global Flood,
                    Second Edition. 1998</em></a> ).
            For example, if the entire planet was flooded, where did all the water go? Various theories have been
            proposed, but none satisfactorily align with scientific understanding or the story's details.
            <br><br>
            Additionally, a global flood would have left geological and ecological markers that we simply do not observe
            today. Some of the problems with these theories include:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>How do you explain the relative ages of mountains?</strong> For example, why weren't the
                    Sierra Nevadas eroded as much as the Appalachians during the Flood?
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>Why is there no evidence of a flood in ice core series?</strong> Ice cores from Greenland
                    have been dated back more than 40,000 years by counting annual layers. <em>[<a
                            href="https://www.nature.com/articles/359311a0" target="_blank">Johnsen et al, 1992 </a>; <a

                        ]</em> A worldwide flood would be expected to leave a layer of
                    sediments,
                    noticeable changes in salinity and oxygen isotope ratios, fractures from buoyancy and thermal
                    stresses, a hiatus in trapped air bubbles, and probably other evidence. <strong>Why doesn't such
                        evidence show up?</strong>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>How are the polar ice caps even possible?</strong> Such a mass of water from the Flood would
                    have provided enough buoyancy to float the polar caps off their beds and break them up. They
                    wouldn't regrow quickly. In fact, the Greenland ice cap would not regrow under modern climatic
                    conditions (last 10,000 years).

            From there, we could examine many other issues with the geological record, where we would expect changes
            that
            are simply not present. Beyond the lack of evidence for a global flood, we have abundant proof that such an
            event never occurred.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>First</strong>, we know of several civilizations that existed before and during the supposed time of
            the flood, and none of them show any signs of being wiped out or disrupted. A few of these civilizations
            include:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><em>Sumerians</em> (4500 - 2000 BCE)</li>
            <li><em>Egyptian Old Kingdom</em> (2686–2181 BCE, with the Great Pyramid at Giza built around 2560 BCE)</li>
            <li><em>Minoans on Crete</em> (2600 - 1100 BCE)</li>
            <li><em>Norte Chico in Peru</em> (3500 - 1800 BCE)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            If there had been a global flood, we would expect to see inscriptions or references to it in places like the
            pyramids of Egypt, but <strong>there is absolutely no mention of a global flood</strong>. This has
            implications for the Book of Abraham, which we will discuss later. How could these civilizations have
            survived a global flood without any record of destruction or interruption?
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Second</strong>, if a global flood did occur, how did animals repopulate the continents so quickly
            and return to the very places where fossil records show they existed before the flood? Scientists have been
            able to date the evolution of humans and animals, and the timeline of a global flood does not allow enough
            time for the natural diversification of species that we observe today.
        </p>

        <p>
            These issues have no satisfactory answers, which is why <strong>all secular scholars and many Bible
                scholars</strong> agree that the flood was not a global event. This leaves open the possibility of a
            local flood, but even that interpretation ignores the text of Genesis and, as we will now outline, raises
            problems for the scriptures of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
        </p>

        <h2>Problems with the Global Flood and the Scriptures of Mormonism</h2>

        <p>
            The Book of Mormon requires a global flood to establish its credibility as an ancient historical text. The
            narrative states that a global flood occurred, asserting its significance within the context of
            the text. Specifically, in the book of Ether, the flood is discussed through the lens of the Jaredite
            plates, which were purportedly created shortly after the flood, around the time of the Tower of Babel. This
            linkage suggests that the events recorded in the Book of Mormon are intended to reflect actual historical
            occurrences.
            <br><br>
            If the global flood described in the Book of Mormon is not regarded as a literal event, it raises profound
            implications for the text's authenticity. The mention of such a monumental event in a purportedly historical
            account would undermine the entire framework of the Book of Mormon, suggesting that <strong>if this event is
                metaphorical</strong>, then <strong>other claims within the text may also lack historical
                veracity</strong> .
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            And it came to pass that when they were buried in the deep there was no water that could hurt them, their
            vessels being tight like unto a dish, and also they were tight like unto the ark of Noah; therefore when
            they were encompassed about by many waters they did cry unto the Lord, and he did bring them forth again
            upon the top of the waters. (Ether 6:7)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This passage does not describe the flood itself but affirms the narrative of Noah and the ark found in
            Genesis. A few chapters later, it clarifies that the flood was both literal and global, encompassing the
            Americas to establish a New Jerusalem, which Joseph Smith revealed to be located in Missouri. As noted in
            Ether:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            2 For behold, they rejected all the words of Ether; for he truly told them of all things, from the beginning
            of man; and that after the waters had receded from off the face of this land it became a choice land above
            all other lands, a chosen land of the Lord; wherefore the Lord would have that all men should serve him who
            dwell upon the face thereof;
            <br><br>
            3 And that it was the place of the New Jerusalem, which should come down out of heaven, and the holy
            sanctuary of the Lord. (Ether 13:2-3)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This poses a significant problem because, as previously mentioned, there is no evidence supporting a global
            flood and considerable evidence against it. Additionally, the Book of Ether clearly states that the Americas
            experienced a flood to preserve the land for the Jaredites, which undermines the notion of a merely
            localized flood.
            <br><br>
            This issue raises further complications for Mormonism, particularly regarding Joseph Smith's assertion about
            the location of Adam and Eve after their expulsion from the Garden of Eden.
            <br><br>
            As outlined in our summary of the <a href="/backup/biblical-scholarship/adam-eve.html" target="_blank">Adam
                and Eve
                narrative</a>, Joseph Smith claimed that Adam-ondi-Ahman was
            where they lived. This assertion is problematic for two reasons: first, Adam and Eve are not recognized as
            historical figures, but rather as later additions to biblical texts; second, Smith's interpretation places
            the Noah story in America. This necessitates a global flood to facilitate Noah's journey from Missouri to
            the Old World. Without a global flood, it becomes impossible for Noah to traverse this distance, and the
            preservation of the Americas for the Jaredites, and later for the Lehites, also hinges on the occurrence of
            such a flood.
            <br><br>
            Furthermore, Alma reinforces the idea of a global flood:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            Yea, and I say unto you that if it were not for the prayers of the righteous, who are now in the land, that
            ye would even now be visited with utter destruction; yet it would not be by flood, as were the people in the
            days of Noah, but it would be by famine, and by pestilence, and the sword. (Alma 10:22)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            The last problem for the Book of Mormon comes in 3 Nephi, where Jesus is repeating a verse about Noah
            originally in Isaiah (54:9).
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            For this, the waters of Noah unto me, for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah should no more go over the
            earth, so have I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee. (3 Nephi 22:9)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This quote is much less problematic than in Ether, but it shows that the flood was a literal, historical
            event in the eyes of the writer of the Book of Mormon, which as we know from science and history simply is
            not the case. And this has been taught throughout the history of the church:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            Prophet John Taylor: “Some people talk very philosophically about tidal waves coming along. But the question
            is—How could you get a tidal wave out of the Pacific ocean, say, to cover the Sierra Nevadas? But the Bible
            does not tell us it was a tidal wave. It simply tells us that "all the high hills that were under the whole
            heaven were covered. Fifteen cubits upwards did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered."
            <strong>That
                is, the earth was immersed. It was a period of baptism.</strong> ” (Journal of Discourses 26:74-75)
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            Prophet Joseph F. Smith: “FLOOD WAS BAPTISM OF EARTH. Now a word as to the reason for the flood. It was the
            baptism of the earth, and that had to be by immersion. <strong>If the water did not cover the entire earth,
                then it
                was not baptized</strong>, for the baptism of the Lord is not pouring or sprinkling. (Doctrines of
            Salvation, Vol.2,
            p.320)”
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            Jeffrey R. Holland: “Such a special place [America] needed now to be kept apart from other regions, free
            from the indiscriminate traveler as well as the soldier of fortune. <strong>To guarantee such sanctity the
                very
                surface of the earth was rent</strong>. In response to God’s decree, the great continents separated and
            the ocean
            rushed in to surround them. The promised place was set apart. Without habitation it waited for the
            fulfillment of God’s special purposes.” (“A Promised Land,” Ensign, Jun 1976, 23)
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>

            teaching was given by Joseph Smith and is still accepted as true doctrine. Given this teaching, Mormons have
            to accept the flood as a global phenomenon." (Mormon Doctrine, Bruce McConkie, "Adam-Ondi-Ahman" p. 19-20)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Last, the church still teaches that the flood was a literal, global flood today that wiped out every living
            person and animal. In the “<a
                href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics?lang=eng">Gospel Topics</a>” page
            on Noah, the church states:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “When the people rejected his message, God commanded Noah to build an ark, gather animals, and prepare for a
            flood. Noah and his sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, and their wives were the only people on the whole earth
            saved from the flood (see Genesis 6:13–22; 7:21–23; Moses 8:16–30).”
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Beyond the Book of Mormon, the necessity of a global flood becomes essential in establishing the Book of
            Abraham as a literal, historical account. The attempt to present the Book of Abraham as a real event hinges
            on the assumption of a literal, global flood. In the first chapter, this flood is not just a backdrop but a
            crucial event that supports the book's historical credibility. Without it, the book would struggle to
            maintain its claim as a literal or real account of ancient events:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            As it was with Noah so shall it be with thee; but through thy ministry my name shall be known in the earth
            forever, for I am thy God. (Abraham 1:19)
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            When this woman discovered the land it was under water, who afterward settled her sons in it; and thus, from
            Ham, sprang that race which preserved the curse in the land. (Abraham 1:24)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Abraham 1:24 states that Egypt was discovered while it was under water by the daughter-in-law of Noah, Ham,
            which makes clear that Egypt was found while the world was underwater by a global flood.
            <br><br>
            As mentioned above, you can ignore all of the problems with the Book of Abraham papyri, facsimiles, and
            translation methods (detailed extensively in our annotated Gospel Topics essay on the Book of Abraham)
            because the Book of Abraham is still dependent on a global flood to be a literal, historical account. If the
            flood did not happen, then the Book of Abraham is not a real account of ancient events.Historians have shown
            definitively that there was no flooding of Egypt. Egyptian history is extensively documented, and there is
            no evidence of a disruption or destruction of its civilization, especially not after the construction of the
            pyramids—an event that occurred centuries before the supposed global flood.
            <br><br>
            If the Book of Abraham is not historical, then all of the doctrines it supports, such as the 'Curse of Ham'
            and the concept of pre-existence, must also be reconsidered as non-historical. Similar to the story of Adam
            and Eve, if there was no literal global flood, the Book of Abraham ceases to be a historical text and
            instead, as LDS historian Richard Bushman has noted, becomes <em>pseudepigrapha</em>. Given the weight of
            this term
            and Bushman’s insight, his full quote is presented below:"
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “These scripture like texts, now numbering in the hundreds, were taken seriously during the first centuries
            of the Christian era when they jostled for inclusion in the Christian and Jewish canons. They were wanted to
            be scriptures. They didn’t quite make the grade, but still hung around in various forms. These are writings
            that had a biblical ring and echoed biblical themes, but for reasons both theological and political, did not
            make it into the canon. The Bible as we know it. They were called pseudepigrapha because they often
            pretended to be authored by a biblical figure and spoke in that prophets voice. Though the actual author, of
            the writing, was unknown. They had names like the Apocryphal Set. The Inquiry of Abraham. The Testament of
            Job. The Apocryphal of Ezekiel.
            <br><br>
            Joseph Smith’s books of Moses and Abraham and the writings of Enoch and the Book of Moses bear a resemblance
            to this large corpus of scriptures in that they came in the form of writings in another persons name. Joseph
            was producing pseudepigrapha at the very time when scholars were taking these writings seriously again.”

        </blockquote>

        <p>
            It is important to note that Joseph Smith’s translation of the Bible introduced the Book of Moses into the
            Mormon canon. The Book of Moses is essentially Joseph Smith's translation and revision of Genesis.
            <br><br>
            This is significant because the Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible is considered to be an inspired
            revision, which Smith received through study and prayer. This provided Joseph Smith with a key opportunity
            to clarify whether the events in Genesis were intended to be understood as historical or as mythical
            accounts meant to explain our origins. As stated in the church’s introduction to the Book of Moses:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            The book of Moses is the Prophet Joseph Smith’s inspired translation of selections from the writings of
            Moses. It contains “the words of God, which he spake unto Moses” (<a class="scripture-ref"
                href="/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.1?lang=eng#p1">Moses 1:1</a>) and commanded Moses to record (see <a

                class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/2.1?lang=eng#p1">2:1</a>). However, “because of
            wickedness” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.23?lang=eng#p23">Moses 1:23</a>),
            many of the words and plain and precious truths he recorded were obscured or lost and are thus not preserved
            in the book of Genesis as it has come to us (see <a class="scripture-ref"

                href="/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/13.26-28?lang=eng#p26">1 Nephi 13:26–28</a>). Consequently, the Lord
            promised to raise up another prophet in the latter days to restore Moses’s words so they would be “had again
            among the children of men” (<a class="scripture-ref"

        <p>
            Similar to the story of Adam and Eve, Joseph Smith retains the literal elements of these narratives in the
            Book of Moses. In the flood story, he goes further by expanding on Noah's words, incorporating references to
            Jesus Christ—an addition that, historically speaking, would be anachronistic. From the Book of Moses:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            23 And it came to pass that Noah continued his preaching unto the people, saying: Hearken, and give heed
            unto my words;
            <br><br>
            24 Believe and repent of your sins and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, even as our
            fathers, and ye shall receive the Holy Ghost, that ye may have all things made manifest; and if ye do not
            this, the floods will come in upon you; nevertheless they hearkened not. (Moses 8:23-24)

            The concept of being baptized in the name of Jesus Christ seems out of place for the time period of Genesis,
            but it aligns with the perspective of a 19th-century author writing with a Christological focus. The verses
            in question are later additions to the Genesis account, and their historical validity hinges on a literal
            interpretation of Noah and a global flood. Joseph Smith concludes the Book of Moses by leaving this verse
            from Genesis unchanged, reinforcing that connection:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            And God said unto Noah: The end of all flesh is come before me, for the earth is filled with violence, and
            behold I will destroy all flesh from off the earth. (Moses 8:30)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Mormon scripture heavily depends on the premise of a literal global flood. Without it, key narratives in
            both the Book of Mormon and the Book of Abraham, which assume a world where all life was wiped out before
            the arrival of these figures, lose their foundation. Additionally, the additions to the Book of Moses would
            undoubtedly be seen as <em>pseudepigrapha</em>, as Richard Bushman suggests, since without a global flood,
            Joseph
            Smith's revisions of Genesis become merely theological insertions. Much like the story of Adam and Eve, it
            seems impossible for Mormon scripture to maintain its integrity without the belief in a literal global
            flood.

        <h2>Apologetic Responses to the Challenges of a Global Flood</h2>

        <p>
            Unlike the story of Adam and Eve, the flood narrative is not as deeply woven into Mormon doctrine, which
            allows for more flexibility within apologetic arguments. However, the issue arises when these apologetic
            responses don't align with the church’s official teachings or beliefs.
            <br><br>
            Starting with FAIR Mormon's approach, I want to highlight some of their responses to the challenges a global
            flood presents for Mormonism. Their <a
                href="https://www.fairlatterdaysaints.org/answers/Detailed_response_to_CES_Letter,_Science#Response_to_claim:_.22Science_has_proven_that_there_was_no_worldwide_flood_4.2C500_years_ago.22"
                target="_blank">introductory statement</a> on this topic is as follows:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “<strong>The Church does not require a belief in a global flood</strong>, despite BYU professor Donald W.
            Parry's article in
            the Ensign. What the Church teaches is that Noah was a real prophet, and that he was commanded to save his
            family along with a number of animals in an ark from a flood which covered his world. “
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This sounds promising, but the issue is that if one rejects the idea of a global flood, it raises doubts
            about the historicity of the Book of Mormon, the Book of Abraham, and the Book of Moses. While it’s
            reassuring to say that belief in a literal flood isn’t required of church members, this stance doesn’t
            resolve the challenges that the absence of a global flood presents for Mormon scripture.
            <br><br>
            FAIR then provides a list of <em>“Many things about the Flood (that) can be accepted regardless of belief
                concerning its nature:”</em>
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            <ul>
                <li>There existed a prophet named Noah.</li>
                <li>Noah was commanded by the Lord to construct an ark.</li>
                <li>Noah warned the people of the impending deluge.</li>
                <li>Noah, his family and the animals he collected were saved from the deluge.</li>
                <li>The Lord made a covenant with Noah and his descendants.</li>
            </ul>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            There are several issues worth addressing here. First, apologists often rely on the argument that 'we can't
            know everything,' dismissing what we do know in order to protect ideas that cannot be definitively
            disproven. In this case, FAIR lists five points that no one can know for certain, while conveniently
            omitting the aspects of Noah’s story we can evaluate—such as the idea of a global flood.
            <br><br>
            Without a global flood, the entire narrative loses credibility as a literal story because the two are
            inextricably linked. This is a common tactic in apologetic arguments, and it's important to highlight,
            especially as it becomes even more problematic when considering other aspects of Mormon theology.
            <br><br>
            Joseph Smith, through revelation, taught that Adam and Eve lived in Missouri, which implies that Noah would
            have had to build the ark in America and use a global flood to reach the Old World. Yet, these points from
            FAIR fail to address this significant issue.
            <br><br>
            Furthermore, the concept of a global flood also affects the Book of Abraham and the Book of Mormon, as both
            claim a global flood that wiped out all life before their respective narratives. Even if we entertain the
            idea of a local flood and accept FAIR’s points for the sake of argument, it might support the Bible's
            account but would severely undermine the integrity of both the Book of Abraham and the Book of Mormon.
            <br><br>
            FAIR concludes by suggesting that members are free to interpret the flood in whatever way they prefer:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “As demonstrated by D&C, a belief that this flood was global in nature is not a requirement for Latter-day
            Saints, we are encouraged to study and teach each other science. Traditionally, many earlier members and
            leaders endorsed the global flood views common in society and Christendom generally. The accumulation of
            additional scientific information have led some to rethink their views as to the nature of the flood. Some
            still believe in a global flood, some believe in multiple floods happening over time, some believe in a
            local flood — one localized to the immediate surroundings of Noah — is the best explanation of the evidence.
            Some believe there was no flood at all. People of different views can be members in good standing.“
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Again, the problems with the flood are not about whether a member can be in good standing with church
            authorities, but about whether or not the scriptures of Mormonism hold up to their truth claims. This is an
            apologetic that seeks to assure those who realize that the flood couldn’t be global that they are welcome,
            but it does nothing to address the problems that it causes to the core truth claims of Mormonism.
            <br><br>
            As we scroll through their apologetics, FAIR concludes as they did with the Adam and Eve problems that
            “without a doubt, the flood is always treated as a global event as it is taught by Church leaders.” That is
            true, but then asks the following:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “The story of a global deluge then appears to be at complete odds with scientific data, which may encourage
            some not only to doubt the scriptures, but to even question the existence of God. Therefore, can one create
            better assumptions about the nature of the Flood of Noah and yet still accept what is taught in Church?”
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This is the apologetic trick of telling members not to throw the baby out with the bathwater. Effectively,
            the idea is that if you let the problem of a global flood cause doubt within the Book of Mormon and Abraham,
            then you must throw all beliefs out. This is a false choice, but this is where they are going as you can see
            immediately after:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “Although this criticism can be directed at the LDS church, it is really directed at anyone who believes in
            a literal reading of the Old and New Testament. LDS leaders have in the past taught the concept of a global
            flood based upon such a reading. We will continue to learn more "line upon line as we create more effective
            ways to understand this issue.”
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Yes, it is true that this challenge applies to all believers in the Hebrew Bible, but the problem is that
            Mormonism builds upon the story of Noah’s flood in the same way it does with Adam and Eve. FAIR attempts to
            link these narratives, yet the Book of Mormon, along with the books of Abraham and Moses, heavily depend on
            the King James Bible—while the King James Bible, in turn, does not rely on the Book of Mormon at all. In
            other words, without the King James Bible, the Book of Mormon, Abraham, and Moses lose their foundation, but
            without the Book of Mormon, the King James Bible remains unaffected.
            <br><br>
            This is a crucial point to understand when exploring biblical scholarship, as many of the unresolved issues
            in Mormonism stem from Joseph Smith expanding these biblical stories through the Book of Mormon, Abraham,
            Moses, and his supposed revelations. While other religions also face challenges with these stories, they do
            not make the same truth claims that Mormonism does through modern revelation.
            <br><br>
            FAIR offers one possible explanation for the problem that a local flood presents, particularly in relation
            to the claim that Noah lived in Missouri before the flood, which I want to quickly highlight:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “One "limited flood" explanation that has been proposed for this is that Noah built his ark and either went
            down the Mississippi River valley, or that he built the ark on the East Coast of the North American
            continent. Another line of thought is that the placement of the Garden on the North American continent was
            more of a symbolic act intended to "sacralize" the land—thus providing it with its own "sacred history"
            similar to that of the Old World. The truth is, however, that the Biblical description of the location of
            the Garden of Eden does not match up with existing Old World geography, any more than it does with New World
            geography.”
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            The suggestion of a localized flood in Missouri that necessitated an ark but also extended far enough to
            reach the Old World is inconsistent with geological evidence. We know there was no global flood because
            scientists have found no major disruptions to life in America during that period. The idea that a flood
            could span from Missouri to the ocean is implausible, and if Noah had been on the East Coast during a local
            flood, there would have been no need for an ark—they could have simply moved inland. In simpler terms, if
            you were evaluating the claims of another religion and they had to revise their teachings this drastically
            to align with modern knowledge, would you still believe them?
            <br><br>
            The notion that the placement of the Garden of Eden on the North American continent was merely symbolic
            contradicts Joseph Smith's revelations, which present Adam-ondi-Ahman as the actual land where Adam and Eve
            lived. This reinterpretation seems to rewrite the church's history in response to the challenges posed by
            scientific evidence, similar to the issues addressed in the Gospel Topics essay on DNA and the Book of
            Mormon.
            <br><br>
            Finally, this statement from FAIR is particularly perplexing:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “the Biblical description of the location of the Garden of Eden does not match up with existing Old
            World geography, any more than it does with New World geography.”
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            As discussed in detail in the Adam and Eve section, the story is not meant to be taken literally; it’s an
            etiological myth meant to explain human origins. So, the idea that the Garden's location doesn't align with
            Missouri or the Old World geography does nothing to resolve the underlying issues. Pointing out
            discrepancies in the biblical account seems only to confuse the matter further, making FAIR's argument feel
            unnecessary and irrelevant to the core discussion.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <p>
            The story of Noah and a global flood is a variation of flood myths that were widespread in ancient cultures,
            bearing strong resemblance to the Epic of Gilgamesh, which was written around 2700 BCE, long before the Book
            of Genesis.
            <br><br>
            Moreover, overwhelming scientific evidence refutes the occurrence of a global flood, indicating that
            civilizations thrived uninterrupted during the period in question. If the story of Adam and Eve is
            understood to be allegorical rather than historical, it stands to reason that Noah, too, may not have been a
            literal figure, but rather a myth intended to help ancient people make sense of their world.
            <br><br>
            While the absence of a historical global flood challenges many religious traditions rooted in the Hebrew
            Bible, the implications are particularly severe for Mormonism. This is because the scriptures of Mormonism
            build upon the narrative of Noah’s flood as literal history. For example, the Book of Mormon suggests that
            the Americas were flooded to pave the way for the establishment of a New Jerusalem, which aligns with Joseph
            Smith’s teachings that Adam and Eve lived in Missouri, the site of the future New Jerusalem.
            <br><br>
            Furthermore, the Book of Abraham begins with the daughter-in-law of Noah discovering Egypt while it was
            still submerged by the floodwaters. This premise necessitates a global flood, as without it, the entire
            narrative would be historically untenable.
            <br><br>
            Joseph Smith also expanded on Noah’s story in the Book of Moses, not only affirming the flood as both
            literal and global, but also incorporating a 19th-century Christian theology by having Noah call upon his
            contemporaries to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ—thousands of years before Christ's birth.
            <br><br>
            As discussed in the overview of Adam and Eve, the challenges posed by biblical scholarship are just as, if
            not more, damaging to the truth claims of Mormonism than other commonly debated issues such as polygamy, the
            gold plates, or the Egyptian papyri. If a global flood never occurred, then the foundational elements of the
            Book of Abraham collapse, as the text describes events that could not have happened.
            <br><br>
            These difficulties compound over time and must be examined in their entirety. The issues are not only
            embedded in the scriptures of Mormonism but are compounded by Joseph Smith’s elaboration on these stories as
            part of his prophetic claims. If these events, as the evidence strongly suggests, did not happen, then
            Smith’s prophetic authority is called into question. And this problem only deepens when considering the
            wider field of biblical scholarship.
        </p>

        <!--call to reflection-->
        <p>
            I understand that this process can be difficult and disillusioning, especially when questioning a faith you
            were raised in or converted to. However, if the church is true, there should be no fear in engaging with
            these materials. As Apostle James Talmage wisely stated:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “The man who cannot listen to an argument which opposes his views either has a weak position or is a weak
            defender of it. No opinion that cannot stand discussion or criticism is worth holding. And it has been
            wisely said that the man who knows only half of any question is worse off than the man who knows nothing of
            it. He is not only one sided, but his partisanship soon turns him into an intolerant and a fanatic. In
            general it is true that nothing which cannot stand up under discussion and criticism is worth defending.”
