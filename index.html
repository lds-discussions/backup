    <h2>LDS Discussions Website</h2>
    <p>
      Thank you for visiting LDS Discussions. Our goal is to explore the
      various topics of Mormonism from a historical perspective using mostly
      LDS sources. The material on this site has been written by members of
      the LDS church that have left, and incorporates both critical and
      apologetic standpoints on each topic. This is all of the information
      that we wish had been available to us years ago, and is all sourced so
      that you can know it is not "anti-Mormon" as so many will claim, but
      just history as we now know it backed up with both sources and our
      beliefs and explanations.

    <p>
      We have gone through and taken the official LDS essays that the church
      released on some of the more controversial issues and annotated them
      with our notes where we feel the church is not being truthful about
      their claims. While the church has taken a positive step forward with
      the admissions in these essays, our annotations make clear that there
      are still serious problems that remain on these topics. These annotated
      essays are long, but they need to be in order to give a full picture of
      these topics that have remained controversial through the history of the
      church.

      Following the release of the new Saints book from the LDS church, we
      have completed a chapter-by-chapter review and fact-check, Saints: The
      Standard of Truth? We have also launched a blog that will have shorter
      posts on current church topics, historical issues, and more.
    </p>

    <p>
      We will be posting new material as we go - and if you have anything you
      would like answered email us at ldsdiscussion@gmail.com
