      <h2>LDS Discussions Website</h2>
      <p>
        Thank you for visiting LDS Discussions. Our goal is to explore the
        various topics of Mormonism from a historical perspective using mostly
        LDS sources. The material on this site has been written by members of
        the LDS church that have left, and incorporates both critical and
        apologetic standpoints on each topic. This is all of the information
        that we wish had been available to us years ago, and is all sourced so
        that you can know it is not "anti-Mormon" as so many will claim, but
        just history as we now know it backed up with both sources and our
        beliefs and explanations.
      </p>

      <p>
        We have gone through and taken the official LDS essays that the church
        released on some of the more controversial issues and annotated them
        with our notes where we feel the church is not being truthful about
        their claims. While the church has taken a positive step forward with
        the admissions in these essays, our annotations make clear that there
        are still serious problems that remain on these topics. These annotated
        essays are long, but they need to be in order to give a full picture of
        these topics that have remained controversial through the history of the
        church.

        Following the release of the new Saints book from the LDS church, we
        have completed a chapter-by-chapter review and fact-check, Saints: The
        Standard of Truth? We have also launched a blog that will have shorter
        posts on current church topics, historical issues, and more.
